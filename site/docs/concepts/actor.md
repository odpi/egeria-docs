# Actor

An *actor* is a person, group of people, or an automated process that is operating in the open metadata ecosystem.  There are three types of actor:

* An [Actor Profile](/concepts/actor-profile) describes a person, team or automated process operating in the open metadata ecosystem.
* An [Actor Role](/concepts/actor-role) describes a collection of responsibilities in the open metadata ecosystem. An actor profile can be *appointed* to a role to show that he/she/they/it are performing those responsibilities.
* A [User Identity](/concepts/user-identity) describes a user account that is defined to a user account.  A user account can be linked to an actor profile to provide information on who/what is using the user account.
