# Community

A community is a anchor point for grouping people and resources together around a common interest.
Communities are typically long running endeavours.

Communities have [members](community-member.md).  These are the people working together in the
community.

The community can gather together a [list of useful resources](useful-resource.md)
and a list of [external references](external-reference.md).

The members can create [forums](#community-forum) on different topics to share information.

The members can attach [comments](comment.md) to the community itself and to forum
contributions, and add replies to them.

Members can also provide [reviews](review.md) to forum contributions.  This includes a star rating and
review comment.

Members can add tags to the community and any of its contents.

Members can also add [a like](like.md) to the community and any of its contents.

## Community Member

A community member is a person whose profile is linked to a [community](community.md).

There are different [roles](#community-roles) a community member can be assigned to.
Each has different privileges.

## Community Forum

A community forum provides a place for a [community](community.md) to store notes and comments
about a specific topic.  Forums can be
created by [community contributors, administrators and leaders](community-roles.md).

Each forum has a name, description and a list of
**forum contributions**.
 
Forum contributions can be created by community members, leaders and administrators.
Each contribution can be updated/deleted by the community administrators.

Anyone can add comments to a forum contribution.  Thus it is
possible for a forum contribution to simply pose a question to the membership
and the membership creates the discussion and possible answers using comments.

## Community roles

[Members](#community-member) of a community are assigned a role.
The roles are additive.

At a minimum, a members is a [Community Observer](community-observer.md).
This means they receive notifications from the community.

This can be upgraded to [Community Contributor](community-contributor.md)
to add the right to post content to the community.

Next is a [Community Administrator](community-administrator.md)
who is given the additional ability to add members and delete inappropriate content.

Finally the [Community Leader](community-leader.md) has all of the powers of
the administrator but really focuses on the health and content of the community - typically
creating forums, keeping the exchange of information flowing, ensuring the
lists of useful resources and external references are up to date, and more.


The person creating a community is the first community leader.
This can be changed.
Typically the community leader assigns administrators to manage the membership lists to free them up
to manage the content.

### Community Observer

A community observer is someone who is interested in a community but is not contributing.

### Community Contributor

A community contributor is a role for a community member 
who is able to create content for the community.
This could be a new [forum](#community-forum) and contributions to any forum, 
comments, likes, tags and reviews.

### Community Administrator

A community administrator is someone who is responsible for managing the membership list of a community.

When a community is created, the administrator defaults to the person who created it.
This can be changed.

### Community Leader

A community leader is a person who gives direction to a community.
