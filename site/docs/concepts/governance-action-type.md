# Governance Action Type

A governance action type is a template for a [governance action](/egeria-docs/concepts/governance-action). A set of linked governance action types form the definition of a [governance action process](/egeria-docs/concepts/governance-action-process).

Governance action types are defined through the [Governance Engine OMAS](/egeria-docs/services/omas/governance-engine/overview) and this OMAS also coordinates the create of a governance action from the governance action type as part of its execution of the governance action process.

## Open metadata type definition

The governance action type is defined in the [0462 Governance Action Type](/egeria-docs/types/0462-Governance-Action-Types) model of the Open Metadata Types.
