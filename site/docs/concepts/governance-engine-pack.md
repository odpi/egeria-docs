# Governance Engine Pack

A *governance engine pack* is a packaging of one or more [governance engine definitions](/concepts/governance-engine-definition) into an [open metadata archive](/concepts/open-metadata-archive) with related governance service implementation jar files.
It is used to distribute the governance engine function to different metadata ecosystems.
