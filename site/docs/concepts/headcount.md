#  Head count limit

A [person role](/concepts/person-role) and a [team role](/concepts/team-role) has an optional *head count* that indicated the maximum number of people that should be appointed to the role.  You can think of it as a planning or funding value that the organization has set.

Egeria does not prevent more people than this limit being appointed to the role, but the [Community Profile OMAS](/services/omas/community-profile/overview) does send a notification (event) to indicate that the limit has been breached.

The organization can choose to increase the head count limit or remove one of the appointed people or ignore the situation.
