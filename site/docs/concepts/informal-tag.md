# Informal Tag

An informal tag is a descriptive label with optional description that can be
attached to resources such as personal profiles, personal messages, personal notes,
community forums and forum contributions, comments and communities.

The process of adding a tag to an object is called *tagging*.

Any user can create, update, delete and assign/unassign informal tags.  Informal tags can be used to mine user knowledge about a topic.

Support for informal tags is found in the [Feedback Manager](/services/omvs/feedback-manager/overview) API.
