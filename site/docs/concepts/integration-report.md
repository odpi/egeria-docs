# Integration Report

An *integration report* describes the changes to open metadata made by:

* an [integration connector](/concepts/integration-connector) during a `refresh()` method call.
* a [governance service](/concepts/governance-service) when it runs a [governance action](/concepts/governance-action).


!!! education "Further information"
    * The [0464](/types/4/0464-Dynamic-Integration-Groups) open metadata type model shows the structure of the integration report. It is a [Referenceable](/types/0/0010-Base-Model/#referenceable), so it can support comments and linked classifications and tags.
