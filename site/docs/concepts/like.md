# Like

A *like* is an attachment that a user can attach to a [referenceable](/concepts/referencable) element to indicate his/her approval of the referenceable's presence or content.  A user can only attach a single *like* to a specific referenceable.  The attachment may be private to the user or public.

Often, data catalogs count up the number of likes attached to an element as a measurement of its popularity.
