# OMAG Server Platform

The *OMAG Server Platform* provides a runtime process for all of [Egeria's services](/services).

When the OMAG Server Platform is first started, all of its REST APIs are visible and callable by external clients. However, only the [Administration Services](/services/admin-services/overview) and [Platform Services](/services/platform-services/overview) are operational at this point. The other services will give an error response if called.

The other services are configured and activated in OMAG Servers using the [administration services](/guides/admin/guide). The configuration operations of the administration services create [configuration documents](/concepts/configuration-document), one for each OMAG Server. Inside a configuration document is the definition of which services to activate for the server. These include:

* The [Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS)](/services/omrs) (any type of server), 
* The [Open Metadata Access Services (OMASs)](/services/omas) (for [metadata access servers](/concepts/metadata-access-servers)), 
* The [Open Metadata Engine Services (OMESs)](/services/omes) (for [engine host](/concepts/engine-host) servers), 
* The [Open Metadata Integration Services (OMISs)](/services/omis) (for [integration daemon](/concepts/integration-daemon) servers) and 
* The [Open Metadata View Services (OMVSs)](/services/omvs) (for [view servers](/concepts/view-servers)).

Each server is configured to support specific set of Egeria services and connect to a specific set of metadata resources.   When it runs, each server is isolated within the platform and so the OMAG Server Platform can be used to support [multi-tenant :material-dock-window:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy){ target=wikipedia } operation for a cloud service, or host a variety of different OMAG Servers needed at a particular location.

## Deployment of the OMAG Server Platform

Once a configuration document is defined, the OMAG Server can be started and stopped multiple times via the [Platform Services](/services/platform-services/overview).

The OMAG Server Platform can host multiple OMAG Servers at any one time and a single server may be active on multiple platforms. The choices are as follows:

![OMAG Server deployment choices](egeria-operations-server-choices-no-description.svg)


- **A** - Each OMAG Server has its own dedicated OMAG Server Platform - useful when only one server is needed in a deployment environment, or there is a desire to keep each server isolated in its own operating system process.
- **B** - Multiple OMAG Servers are hosted on the same OMAG Server Platform. The OMAG Server Platform routes inbound requests to the right server based on the server name specified in the request URL. The servers may all be of the same type offering the same services but to different groups of people or be a set of collaborating servers of different types consolidated onto the same platform.
- **C** - Multiple copies of same server instance each running on different platforms to provide high availability and distribution of workload (horizontal scalability).

The OMAG Server platform is included in the [Egeria Distribution TAR file](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/tree/main/open-metadata-distribution/open-metadata-assemblies) which can be installed on your machine by following the [Installing Egeria Tutorial](/education/tutorials/building-egeria-tutorial/task-installing-egeria).

## Inside the OMAG Server platform

Figure 1 shows the OMAG Server platform when it first starts up.

![Figure 1](omag-server-platform-start-up.svg)
> Figure 1: OMAG Server Platform at start up

The [platform origin service](/services/platform-services/overview/#platform-origin) is operational at this point.  It can be used by operational scripts to determine if the OMAG Server platform is still running.

The administration services are also active, while the open metadata and governance services will return an error if called since there are no [OMAG Servers](/concepts/omag-server) running.

The configuration services are used to create [configuration documents](/concepts/configuration-document).  Each configuration document describes the open metadata and governance services that should be activated in a OMAG Server. Figure 2 shows the configuration services creating three configuration documents:

* one for the `cdoMetadataRepository` OMAG Server
* one for the `stewardshipServer` OMAG Server
* one for the `dataLakeDiscoveryEngine` OMAG Server

![Figure 2](omag-server-platform-configure.svg)
> Figure 2: Creating configuration documents for OMAG Servers

The [Administration Guide](/guides/admin/guide) provides detailed instructions on creating configuration documents.

Once a configuration document for an OMAG Server is used by the operational services initialize the requested services in the OMAG Server. The OMAG Server can be started in any OMAG Server platform. It does not have to be the same OMAG Server platform that created the configuration document.

Figure 3 shows an OMAG Server platform with the **cdoMetadataRepository** local OMAG Server running.

> Figure 3: Starting a OMAG Server through the operational services

Once the OMAG Server has initialized successfully, the open metadata and governance services can route requests to it.

An OMAG Server platform can run multiple OMAG Servers at one time.  Figure 4 shows an OMAG Server platform running multiple servers.
