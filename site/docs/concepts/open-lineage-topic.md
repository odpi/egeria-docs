# Open Lineage Topic

The Open Metadata Topic is an [event topic](/concepts/basic-concepts) used to receive open lineage events into Egeria.  These events are sent by the *open lineage proxy* and received by the [integration daemon](integration-daemon.md).

![Open Lineage Topic](open-lineage-topic.svg)

Egeria's [leveraging Open Lineage](/egeria-solutions/leveraging-open-lineage/overview) solution harvests the open lineage events to enhance the open metadata ecosystem AND publishes open lineage events to enhance the open lineage ecosystem.
