# Organization

An organization is independently run body that has a specific purpose.
It owns assets and involves people and other organizations through contracts to
exchange particular goods and services
for money.

As organizations grow the people who are part of the organization are organized into [teams](#teams).
Teams can exist for many purposes - for example, a team may be formed to deliver a [project](project.md).
Teams have their own structures that include [team leaders](/egeria-docs/concepts/person-role#team-leader) and [team members](/egeria-docs/concepts/person-role#team-member).

Often an organization has a hierarchy of teams called the [departmental structure](#departmental-structure).

# Teams

A team is a group of people working together typically to achieve a common purpose.

Teams can be linked together to form a hierarchy.

# Departmental Structure

The departmental structure is a hierarchy of [teams](#teams) that includes everyone in
the organization in at least one of the teams.

The departmental structure can be loaded into an open metadata repository through the Community Profile OMAS as follows:
