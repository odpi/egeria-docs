# Person Role

A person role is a placeholder in a [team](/features/people-roles-organizations), [project](/concepts/project) or [community](/concepts/community) that defines a set of skills and responsibilities that one or more individuals can perform.

Individuals are then appointed to the role.  This creates a relationship between their [profile](/concepts/personal-profile) and the role.  This relationship is then removed when the individual leaves the role.  It is not unusual for [effectivity dates](/features/effectivity-dates) to be used with this relationship to allow people to be appointed and removed from roles ahead of time, creating a smooth transition.

It is also common that an individual performs many roles in an organization.
