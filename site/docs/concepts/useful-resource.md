# Useful Resources

A useful resource is definition that is used frequently and so it is helpful to have a link to it.
Examples of resources include glossaries, or categories and terms from a glossary,
governance definitions, models, system definitions or process definitions.

It is possible to maintain a list of useful resources for a
[personal profile](/concepts/personal-profile), 
a [team](/concepts/organizations/#team) or a [community](/concepts/community).
