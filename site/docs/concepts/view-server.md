# View Server

A *view server* is an [OMAG Server](/concepts/view-server) that hosts the REST API services to support a UI. These REST API services are called [Open Metadata View Services (OMVSs)](/services/omvs) and they are designed to support specific display paradigms needed by different types of UIs.

The view services are typically called by third parties.
