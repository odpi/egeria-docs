## Overview

---8<-- "snippets/systems/apache-atlas-intro.md"

The Apache Atlas Survey Action Service builds a [survey report](/concepts/survey-report) that describes the types defined in the Apache Atlas server and the numbers of instances that are found for these types.

## Survey action service function

The Apache Atlas Survey Action Service provides a summary of the contents of the Apache Atlas repository found at the time it was run.

It has three analysis steps:

1. Measure Resource - Retrieves the overall metrics from the Apache Atlas server.  These are stored in a [*ResourceMeasureAnnotation*](/types/0660-Resource-Measures) entity linked to the [*SurveyReport*](/types/6/0603-Survey-Reports) entity generated for each run of the Apache Atlas Survey Action Service.
2. Schema Extraction - Retrieves the types from Apache Atlas and organizes them in a linked graph of [*Schema Attributes*](/types/5/0533-Graph-Schemas) entities.  All the graph schema attributes are linked to a [*GraphSchemaType*](/types/5/0533-Graph-Schemas) entity which is in turn linked to the [*SurveyReport*](/types/6/0603-Survey-Reports) entity.
3. Profile Data - Retrieves each entity in the Apache Atlas server and adds the following counts to [*ResourceProfileAnnotation*](/types/6/0620-Resource-Profiling) entities linked from the appropriate data field entities:

    * The number of instances of each entity type.
    * The number of classifications of a particular type attached to each type of entity.
    * The number of relationships of a particular type attached to each type of entity.
    * The number of each type of label attached to each type of entity.
    * The number of business metadata properties of a particular type attached to each type of entity.

Each analysis step builds on the work of its predecessor. The processing requirements increase with each step, so you can choose to stop the processing after any step using the `finalAnalysisStep` property.  This can be set as a configuration property in the connection object for this survey action service, or as a request parameter passed when the Apache Atlas Survey Action Service is run.

The default value for `finalAnalysisStep` is `Profile Data`.

## Metadata Setup

Prior to running the Apache Atlas Survey Action Service, an [asset](/concepts/asset) and [connection](/concepts/connection) must be created for the Apache Atlas server that is to be analysed.

Typically, the asset for Apache Atlas is of type [*SoftwareServer*](/types/0/0040-Software-Server) with a *deployedImplementationType* set to *Apache Atlas Server*.  The `networkAddress` in the connection's [endpoint](/concepts/endpoint) is the hostname and port of the Apache Atlas server.  For example, `http://localhost:21000`.

## Survey Reports

Each time the Apache Atlas Survey Action Service runs, there is a new [survey report](/concepts/survey-report) created.

Figure 4 shows the structure of the survey report.  The annotations are labelled with the analysis steps that create them.

### Resource Measurements Annotation

The resource measurements annotation is created in the *Measure Resource* analysis step.  It sets up the following properties in the *dataSourceProperties* map:

* entityInstanceCount - number of active entity instances
* entityInstanceCount:*typeName* - number of active entity instance of this type
* entityWithSubtypesInstanceCount:*typeName* - number of active entity instances of this type and all subtypes.
* classificationCount - number of classifications added to entity instances.
* typeCount - number of defined types (and their versions).
* typeUnusedCount - number of types with no instances.

This analysis is achieved using two REST API calls and so has minimum impact on the Apache Atlas Server.

### Schema Analysis Annotation

The schema analysis annotation is created in the *Schema Extraction* analysis step.  It identifies the name/type of the schema created.

### Apache Atlas Types as a schema

In the *Schema Extraction* analysis step, the apache atlas types extracted from the Apache Atlas server are used to create a schema that describes the graph structure of the metadata found in the Apache Atlas server:

* A [*GraphVertex*](/types/5/0533-Graph-Schemas) entity is created for each Apache Atlas entity type, business metadata type and classification type.  
* A [*GraphEdge*](/types/5/0533-Graph-Schemas) entity is created for each Apache Atlas relationship type, and each permitted use of a classification type by an entity type.

*GraphVertex* and *GraphEdge* are types of [*SchemaAttribute*](/types/5/0505-Schema-Attributes).  The graph schema attributes are connected together using [*GraphEdgeLink*](/types/5/0533-Graph-Schemas) relationships that connect each GraphEdge schema attribute to two GraphVertex schema attributes.

* The relationship type graph edges are each attached to two entity type graph vertices: one for the type of entity that can be attached at end 1 of the relationship; the other for the type of entity that can be attached at end 2.
* The classification type permitted use graph edges are linked to each of the associated entity type graph vertices.

All the graph vertices are linked to a [*GraphSchemaType*](/types/5/0533-Graph-Schemas) entity using the [*AttributeForSchema*](/types/5/0505-Schema-Attributes) relationship.  The *GraphSchemaType* entity is linked to the asset for the Apache Atlas server using the [Schema](/types/5/0503-Asset-Schema/) relationship.

### Resource Profile Annotation

This survey action service attaches multiple resource profile annotations to each graph schema attribute depending on their category (entity, relationship, classification or business metadata).

![Figure 6](apache-atlas-survey-action-service-profile.svg)
> **Figure 6:** Details of the resource profile annotations attached to each type of data field

It sets up the following fields in each resource profile annotation:

* *analysisStep* - this is always set to *Profile Resource*.
* *annotationType* - this identifies the type of values that the annotation contains.
* *explanation* - this provides more information about the annotation type.
* *valueCount* - this is a map of typeName to count.  For example, if this annotation was counting the classifications attached to the *DataSet* entity type, then the map would include an entry for each type of classification attached to this type of entity and a count of how many times it is used.
* *additionalProperties* - contains the count of instances for the particular type that the data field represents.

The table summarizes the values in each of the resource profile annotations depending on the category of the data field it is attached to.
