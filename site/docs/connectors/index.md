# Connector catalog

Egeria has a growing collection of *connectors* to third party technologies. These connectors help to accelerate the rollout of your open metadata ecosystem since they can be used to automate the extraction and distribution of metadata to the third party technologies.

A connector is a client to a third party technology. It supports a standard API that Egeria calls, and it then translates these calls into requests to the third party technology. Some connectors are also able to listen for notifications from the third party technology. When a notification is received, the connector converts its content into a call to Egeria to distribute the information to the open metadata ecosystem.

Connectors enable Egeria to operate in many environments and with many types of third party technologies, just by managing the configuration of the [OMAG servers](/concepts/omag-server). The Connector Catalog list the connector implementations supplied by the Egeria community. There are three broad categories of connectors and the connector catalog is organized accordingly:

* Connectors that support the [exchange and maintenance of metadata](#metadata-exchange-and-maintenance-connectors). This includes the integration connectors, repository connectors, discovery services and governance action services.

* Connectors that support [Egeriaâ€™s runtime](#runtime-connectors). This includes the event bus connectors, cohort registry stores, configuration stores, audit log destination connectors, open metadata archive stores, REST client connectors and the cohort member remote repository connectors

* Connectors that provide access to [digital resources and their metadata](#digital-resource-connectors) that is stored in the open metadata ecosystem.

## Metadata exchange and maintenance connectors

The connectors that support the exchange and maintenance of metadata help to accelerate the rollout of your open metadata ecosystem since they can be used to automate the extraction and distribution of metadata to the third party technologies.

#### Cataloguing Files

The *files* integration connectors run in the [Files Integrator Open Metadata Integration Service (OMIS)](/services/omis/files-integrator/overview) hosted in the [integration daemon](/concepts/integration-daemon).

| Files Integration Connectors | Description |
|---|---|
| [Data files monitor](/connectors/integration/data-files-monitor-integration-connector) | Maintains a `DataFile` asset for each file in the directory (or any subdirectory). When a new file is created, a new DataFile asset is created.  If a file is modified, the lastModified property of the corresponding DataFile asset is updated.  When a file is deleted, its corresponding DataFile asset is also deleted (or archived if it is still needed for lineage). |
| [Data folder monitor](/connectors/integration/data-folder-monitor-integration-connector) | Maintains a `DataFolder` asset for the directory.  The files and directories underneath it are assumed to be elements/records in the DataFolder asset and so each time there is a change to the files and directories under the monitored directory, it results in an update to the lastModified property of the corresponding DataFolder asset. |

| [In-memory OMRS Repository Connector](/connectors/repository/in-memory/overview)    | provides a simple native repository implementation that "stores" metadata in HashMaps within the JVM; it is used for testing, or for environments where metadata maintained in other repositories needs to be cached locally for performance/scalability reasons.  |
| [Read-only OMRS Repository Connector](/connectors/repository/read-only/overview)    | provides a native repository implementation that does not support the interfaces for create, update, delete; however, it does support the search interfaces and is able to cache metadata -- this means it can be loaded with open metadata archives to provide standard metadata definitions. |

The table below lists the repository connectors that act as an adapter for third party metadata repositories.
