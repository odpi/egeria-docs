## Overview

[Apache Atlas](https://atlas.apache.org) is a metadata catalog originally designed for the Hadoop ecosystem.  It offers integration services called Hooks and Bridges to capture the schemas and data sets of data platforms such as [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/), [Apache HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/) and [Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsUserGuide.html) along with the processes for creating and maintaining data sets on these platforms.  The metadata descriptions of these data sets and processes are linked together using lineage relationships, allowing an understanding of how data is flowing through a Hadoop deployment.  Apache Atlas also supports glossaries and a tagging system that can be used both in searches and to control access to data through Apache Ranger (using the TagSync integration).

In recent years, Apache Atlas has been embedded in popular data catalogs such as [Microsoft Purview](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/purview/) and [Atlan](https://atlan.com/) increasing the interest in being able to integrate with this metadata catalog.

Reasons for integrating Apache Atlas into a wider open metadata ecosystem include:

* To push glossaries and classification definitions to Apache Atlas so its users get to use the same definitions for the governance of their data as other parts of the organization.  This may simply to help start up a new Apache Atlas deployment, or as part of a broader consistency initiative.
* To share glossaries and classification definitions that have been developed by an Apache Atlas user community in order to seed other projects and tools.
* To share details of the data sets that Apache Atlas has catalogued with other catalogs and tools.  For example, the Apache Atlas catalog of data sets may be shared with data science or stewardship tools.  Tags, classifications and semantic assignments made to these assets by users of these tools could then be pushed back to Apache Atlas to enhance the use and governance of their associated data through Apache Atlas.
* To extract lineage information for data flowing through the data platforms and processes that Apache Atlas is capturing.

## Integration Connector function

The Apache Atlas integration connector provides an ongoing exchange of metadata between Apache Atlas and the open metadata ecosystem.  In its initial state, it focuses on the two-way exchange of glossaries.  Future versions will add entities (such as data sets and process), lineage and classifications.

![Figure 1](apache-atlas-catalog-integration-connector.svg)
> **Figure 1:** Operation of the Apache Atlas integration connector

Specifically this connector:

* Publishes glossaries, glossary categories and ACTIVE glossary terms that originate from the open metadata ecosystem into Apache Atlas.  The connector makes no attempt to detect changes to these glossary elements in Apache Atlas.  Additionally, such changes will be overridden the next time the integration connector refreshes the glossary metadata in Apache Atlas.
* Publishes glossaries, glossary categories and glossary terms that originate in Apache Atlas into the open metadata ecosystem.  These elements will be read-only in the open metadata ecosystem.


### Metadata ownership 

The concept of ownership of each metadata instance (such as glossary, glossary catalog and glossary term) is strictly maintained.  Simply:

* If the instance was originally created in the open metadata ecosystem, it is owned by the open metadata ecosystem and any changes or deletions made to the copy in Apache Atlas will be reversed the next time the connector refreshes the Apache Atlas metadata.
* If the instance was originally created in Apache Atlas, it is owned by Apache Atlas.  When the instance is copied into the open metadata ecosystem, its [provenance](/features/metadata-provenance/overview) is set to indicate that this Apache Atlas server is its origin, which effectively makes it read-only in the open metadata ecosystem.

It is possible to create a new glossary term or glossary category in Apache Atlas within a glossary that originated from the open metadata ecosystem.  This new entity will be owned by Apache Atlas, even though it belongs to a glossary that is owned by the open metadata ecosystem.

Similarly, it is possible to create new glossary terms and categories in the open metadata ecosystem that are linked to a glossary that originated from Apache Atlas.  These new entities will be owned by the open metadata ecosystem.



### Correlation

In order to correlate the instances in Apache Atlas with the open metadata ecosystem instance, the connector:

* Adds two properties to the Apache Atlas glossary instances' *additionalAttributes* attribute:

    * *egeriaGUID* provides the unique identifier of the equivalent instance in the open metadata ecosystem.
    * *egeriaOwned* is a boolean flag describing whether the instance is owned by the open metadata ecosystem (true) or Apache Atlas (false).

## Configuration

The Apache Atlas integration connector runs in an [Integration Daemon](/concepts/integration-daemon).  There are two parts to the configuration:

* The specification of the connection object the controls the behaviour of the connector itself.
* The inclusion of the connection object in the configuration of the Integration Daemon.

### The connection object

The [connection](/concepts/connection) object provides information about configurations properties and the endpoint where Apache Atlas is running.  A connection object has the following structure:

![Connection structure](/concepts/connection.svg)

The *Connection* defines the specific use of the connector.  The *Connector Type* identifies the implementation of connector to run and the *Endpoint* identifies the host and port where the Apache Atlas server is running.

Apache Atlas typically runs with *Basic Authorization* - that is a userId and password is passed in the header of REST API calls to Apache Atlas.  This userId and password are specified as *userId* and *clearPassword* properties in the connection object.

??? tip "Using secrets for Apache Atlas's userId and password"
    If you are uncomfortable with specifying the userId and password for Apache Atlas in the clear it is possible to embed a connection for a [Secrets Store Connector](/concepts/secrets-store-connector) in the connection for the Apache Atlas integration connector.  The secrets store connector will dynamically retrieve the userId and password when the connector starts up.

Finally, there is an optional set of configuration properties that controls the behaviour of the Apache Atlas integration connector:

* *egeriaGlossaryQualifiedName* specifies the qualified name of a single Egeria glossary to publish to Apache Atlas.  If this property is omitted, all glossaries found in the open metadata ecosystem will be copied into Apache Atlas.
* *atlasGlossaryName* specifies the name of a single Apache Atlas glossary that is to be synchronized with the open metadata ecosystem.  If this property is omitted, all glossaries found in Apache Atlas will be copied into the open metadata ecosystem.

!!! example "Example connection for the Apache Atlas integration connector"
    ```json linenums="1" hl_lines="14 16-17 20-21"
    {
        "connection" : 
        { 
            "class" : "Connection",
            "qualifiedName" : "Egeria:IntegrationConnector:Catalog:Apache Atlas Connection",
            "connectorType" : 
            {
                "class" : "ConnectorType",
                "connectorProviderClassName" : "org.odpi.openmetadata.adapters.connectors.integration.apacheatlas.ApacheAtlasIntegrationProvider"
            },
            "endpoint" :
            {
                "class" : "Endpoint",
                "address" : "{{atlasServerURL}}"
            },
            "userId" : "{{atlasUserId}}",
            "clearPassword" : "{{atlasPassword}}",
            "configurationProperties" :
            {
                "egeriaGlossaryQualifiedName" : "{{glossaryQualifiedName}}",
                "atlasGlossaryName" : "{{glossaryName}}"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    - Replace `{{atlasServerURL}}` with the URL of the Apache Atlas server.
    - Replace `{{atlasUserId}}` with the userId passed on each REST API call to the Apache Atlas server.
    - Replace `{{atlasPassword}}` with the password passed on each REST API call to the Apache Atlas server.
    - Replace `{{glossaryQualifiedName}}` with the qualified name of the Egeria glossary to publish to Apache Atlas.
    - Replace `{{glossaryName}}` this with the name of a single Apache Atlas glossary that is to be synchronized with the open metadata ecosystem.

### Adding the connection to Egeria's configuration

This connector runs in the [Integration Daemon](/concepts/integration-daemon) and uses the [Catalog Integrator OMIS](/services/omis/catalog-integrator/overview) interface to access the open metadata ecosystem.

Once you have the connection specified for the Apache Atlas integration connector, you have two choices on how to add it to Egeria's configuration:

* *Static configuration* by adding it directly to the [configuration document](/concepts/configuration-document) for the Integration Daemon.  This creates a static configuration that requires a restart of the Integration Daemon to change the configuration.
* *Dynamic configuration* by adding it to an open metadata [integration group](concepts/integration-group).  The integration group is stored in the open metadata repository of a [Metadata Access Store](/concepts/metadata-access-store). The associate Integration Daemon(s) immediately adapts what they are running as changes are made to the integration group contents.

Whichever method is used, there are four properties that will affect the behaviour of your connector:

* *metadataSourceQualifiedName* provides a unique name for your Apache Atlas server instance.  This value is used to identify the origin of the metadata that comes from your Apache Atlas server instance.  If you were running multiple Apache Atlas servers, each one should have its own *metadataSourceQualifiedName*.
* *refreshTimeInterval* defines the number of minutes between each scan the connector makes to find new metadata or changes to metadata.  The value to use depends on how often the metadata is likely to change.  It could, for instance be set to 1440 for the connector to run a refresh scan once a day.
* *usesBlockingCalls* must be set to *false*.
* *permittedSynchronization* defines which direction metadata is to flow. It may be:

    * *FROM_THIRD_PARTY* meaning that metadata only flows from Apache Atlas to the open metadata ecosystem.
    * *TO_THIRD_PARTY* meaning that metadata only flows from the open metadata ecosystem to Apache Atlas.
    * *BOTH_DIRECTIONS* meaning the metadata flows between the open metadata ecosystem and Apache Atlas in both directions.

??? education "Configuring the Integration Daemon"
    See [Configuring the integration connectors](/guides/admin/servers/configuring-an-integration-daemon/#configuring-the-integration-connectors) to find out how to add you connection object to the integration daemon.  For example, issuing the following command adds the Apache Atlas connection information to the Catalog Integrator OMIS in an Integration Daemon identified by `{integrationDaemonName}}`.  

    ```
    POST {{baseURL}}/open-metadata/admin-services/users/{{adminUserId}}/servers/{{integrationDaemonName}}/integration-services/catalog-integrator
    ```

                    },
                    "endpoint": {
                        "class": "Endpoint",
                        "address": "http://54798.cocopharmaceuticals.org:21000"
                    },
                    "userId" : "admin",
                    "clearPassword" : "admin"
                },
                "metadataSourceQualifiedName": "ApacheAtlasDL01",
                "refreshTimeInterval": "1440",
                "usesBlockingCalls": "false",
                "permittedSynchronization": "BOTH_DIRECTIONS"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```


## Implementation

The Apache Atlas integration connector makes use of the [Apache Atlas Glossary REST API](https://atlas.apache.org/api/v2/index.html) to query and update the metadata in Apache Atlas.  This REST API is divided into different groups of operations that each follow their own style. 

* *DiscoveryREST* provides the ability to search for entities, relationships and classifications.
* *EntityREST* supports the maintenance of entity instances.
* *GlossaryREST* supports both the querying and maintenance of glossaries, glossary categories and glossary terms.
* *LineageREST* provides for the capture and retrieval of lineage information for an entity.
* *RelationshipREST* supports the maintenance of relationship instances.
* *TypesREST* supports the definition and retrieval of type definitions.

This difference in style is why the Apache Atlas integration connector provides different capabilities for different types of metadata.  For example:

* Glossary terms can only be updated in their origin server because the Apache Atlas Glossary REST API does not record the version and update time to glossary element instances making it impossible to reconcile the order that updates have been made across the open metadata ecosystem and Apache Atlas.
* Entities/relationships do not have a standard place to store additional attributes, so it is not possible to store the corresponding unique identifier from the open metadata ecosystem.  The consequence is that entity and relationship metadata can only flow from Apache Atlas to the open metadata ecosystem.
