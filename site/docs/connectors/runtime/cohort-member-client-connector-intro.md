Members of an [Open Metadata Repository Cohort](/egeria-docs/concepts/cohort-member) provide the other cohort members with a Connection to a connector that supports the OMRSRepositoryConnector interface during the cohort registration process. This connector translates calls to retrieve and maintain metadata in the member's repository into remote calls to the real repository.
