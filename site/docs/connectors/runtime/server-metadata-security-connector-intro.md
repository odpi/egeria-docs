The *server metadata security connector* provides authorization support for requests to an [OMAG Server](/concepts/omag-server).  There is one server metadata security connector configured for each OMAG Server.

![Server Metadata Security Connector](/connectors/runtime/server-metadata-security-connector.svg)

This connector is called each time a request is made to the server.  It is called to:

* Validate the user has access to the server.
* Validate the user has access to the called operation.
* Select which zones to associate with the requests based on the user.
* If the request involves an asset, then does the user have access to the asset and which properties are they allowed to see.
* If the request is for a connection for an asset, then select which one linked to the asset should be returned to the user.
* Determine which events to sent to the cohort.
* Determine what actions can be made on the metadata repository.
