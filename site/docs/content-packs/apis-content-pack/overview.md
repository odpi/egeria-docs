# Open APIs Content Pack

The *APIsContentPack* contains the connector definitions for the connector the catalogs an open API through its swagger REST API.  This connector is supplied in the *omag-server-platform* distribution. This content pack is designed to provide a good starting point for connecting Egeria to applications supporting the open API specification in order to build an API catalog.
