# Cloud Information Model (CIM) Content Pack

The *CloudInformationModel* content pack is an extraction for a glossary for the Cloud Information Model's data model.  It is created by processing glossary from the Cloud Information Model's [JSONLD formatted model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudinformationmodel/cloudinformationmodel/master/dist/model.jsonld). The content covers basic commerce concepts such as Party, Product, Invoice and Shipping. The cloud information project has been archived so there will be no further updates. However, it still provides a useful starter set glossary.

This archive is available on GitHub as `CloudInformationModel.omarchive` at [https://github.com/odpi/egeria/blob/main/content-packs/CloudInformationModel.json](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/blob/main/content-packs/CloudInformationModel.json).  It is also included in Egeria's standard `omag-server-platform` distribution built from the `egeria.git` repository.
