# Egeria Dojo - Developer Day

Egeria has an extensive set of APIs and asynchronous event interactions for retrieving and maintaining metadata.    It is also possible to write connectors that execute in Egeria's runtime and either:

- Provide Egeria access to third party technology and resources.
- Provide the mechanism to synchronize metadata between a third party technology and the open metadata ecosystem that Egeria orchestrates.

Connectors can also be called in your applications to access third party technology along with its associated metadata.

Finally, Egeria's open metadata archives have a wide set of uses in distributing standard definitions and types.

After completing developer day of the egeria dojo you should feel comfortable with calling Egeria's APIs, writing connectors and working with open metadata archives.

## Preparing your machine for the Dojo

!!! tip "In preparation ..."
    Egeria's interfaces are written in Java.  It is expected that you have basic Java skills and have the Java 17 SDK installed on your machine.
    
    ??? tip "Installing Java ..."
        --8<-- "docs/education/tutorials/building-egeria-tutorial/task-installing-java.md"

    You will need to build Egeria's source which needs Apache Maven installed.
    
    ??? tip "Installing Apache Maven ..."
        --8<-- "docs/education/tutorials/building-egeria-tutorial/task-installing-maven.md"

    During the dojo you will running Apache Kafka to experiment with event notifications.

    The dojo makes use of egeria libraries and code samples in the following git repositories and you will need a clone of them on your machine.
    
    - https://github.com/odpi/egeria
    - https://github.com/odpi/egeria-samples
    - https://github.com/odpi/egeria-dev-projects

        --8<-- "docs/education/tutorials/git-and-git-hub-tutorial/task-downloading-egeria-source.md"

    Many of the contributors to the Egeria project use the *[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)* IDE.  Jetbrains offers a [free community edition of IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) which is sufficient to work with Egeria.  You are free to use any IDE during the dojo, however the instructions will focus on IntelliJ IDEA.

    Congratulations, you are ready to begin.

## Dojo Activities

        --8<-- "docs/guides/developer/developer-choices.md"
        
        In this dojo, you will have an opportunity to build and run Java utilities and connectors.  However before you get to the coding, you will spend some time setting up your development and test environment.
        
    ??? beginner "Setting up your IDE to use Egeria (30 mins)"
        
        You need to bring the main `egeria.git` code into IntelliJ to build its platform and clients.
        
        ??? beginner "Building Egeria's core libraries (15 mins)"
            --8<-- "docs/education/tutorials/intellij-tutorial/task-loading-egeria-into-intellij.md"
            
            Now build the egeria.git repository.  For the Dojo, it is OK to use the *Quick Build* option when offered.
            
            --8<-- "docs/education/tutorials/intellij-tutorial/intellij-building-egeria-git.md"
        
        Once Egeria's core libraries are built, it is helpful to install Egeria in a directory that is easy to find.

    ??? beginner "Setting up your Test environment (30 mins)"
    
        The `egeria-dev-projects.git` repository contains the utilities to support your Egeria test environment. This was one of the git repositories that you cloned in the prerequisite tasks.  Open this git repository in IntelliJ.
        
        ??? tip "Opening egeria-dev-projects.git in IntelliJ IDEA ..."
            Use **File**->**Open...** and select the top-level `egeria-dev-projects` directory that was downloaded from GitHub in the file selection window. Click the **Open** button.

        Now build the `egeria-dev-projects` code ...

        Egeria's services run in the [OMAG Server Platform](/concepts/omag-server-platform).  The jar file for the OMAG Server Platform was built by the `egeria.git` build.  It is located in the `platform` directory of your Egeria install and is called `omag-server-platform-{{release}}.jar`.  You will need an easy way to start and stop the OMAG Server Platform.   This is done with an IntelliJ *Configuration*.
        
        ??? beginner "Set up IntelliJ to run the OMAG Server Platform ..."

                ---8<-- "docs/education/egeria-dojo/developer/different-types-of-apis-server-running.md"

            !!! education "Summary and further study"
                From this section of the developer dojo, you should have an understanding of the behaviour of the Platform Services and Administration Services.
                
                * `ServerConfig` is using the Administration Services to configure different types of OMAG Servers.
                * `ServerOps` is using the Administration Services to start and stop named OMAG Servers.
                * `EgeriaPlatformReport` is blending information from the platform's deployment with information about configured servers, known servers and active servers.  This information comes both from the Administration Services and Platform Services.
                
                The `egeria-dev-projects` utilities are designed to illustrate how to use these services and you may want to take time to review the code and make changes to explore new functions or customize them to your working environment.
                
                Itching to code? The next section gives you an opportunity to write your own utilities that work with the OMAS APIs.  This may be a good time to take a break :)
                   
        ??? beginner "Writing a simple client program that creates, updates, finds and deletes metadata. (60 mins)"
        
            In this section, you will be creating two new utilities: one called `AssetCreate` that catalogs a collection of files as assets; the other is called `AssetListen` which listens for newly created asset events and prints out details about the asset.  You can think of it as a game of catch: `AssetCreate` is throwing assets into the catalog and `AssetListen` is catching them.

            ??? beginner "Develop AssetListen"
                Create a new IntelliJ project called `egeria-dojo2` that contains an empty Java class called `egeria.dojo.assetlisten.AssetListen`.

                ??? tip "Hint if you are not sure what to do  ..."
                    The java package is `egeria.dojo.assetlisten` and the Java class name is `AssetListen`.
