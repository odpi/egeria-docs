## Automating metadata capture

People are not good at repetitive admin tasks, particularly if these tasks are not the primary focus of their work. Therefore, the open metadata ecosystem is more complete and accurate when automation supports these mundane tasks.  Following our three step model, the automation needs to:

* monitor for triggers that indicate that metadata needs to be updated,
* drive the necessary changes to metadata and then 
* make those changes visible to downstream processing.
