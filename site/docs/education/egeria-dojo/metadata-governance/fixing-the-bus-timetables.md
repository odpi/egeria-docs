The managing director considered the inaccurate bus timetable information as a serious problem that urgently needed fixing.  She discovered that the manager responsible for scheduling the bus drivers' shifts was the one who made changes to the timetable.  These changes typically occurred whenever there was a persistent difficulty in assigning a bus driver to a route.  Whenever this happened, he briefed the affected driver with the change and asked that they disseminate the information to their passengers.

The bus driver's manager was given ownership for ensuring the bus timetables were accurate at each bus stop since he was responsible for the action that triggered a need to update the timetables.  He also understood the scope of any change.

The bus driver's manager was given a new assistant.  Part of the assistant's role was to make changes to the master timetables when necessary, arrange for the downloadable timetables to deliver the new version, get printed copies to the bus station and tourist information office and add an article to the local paper describing the change.  They would also drive around to the affected bus stops and update the timetable as well as ensure the affected busses had new copies of the bus timetable onboard for their regular customers.
