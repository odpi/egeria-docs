## The open metadata ecosystem

The content of the data/metadata shared between teams needs to follow standards that ensure clarity both in meaning and how it should be used and managed.  Its completeness and quality need to be appropriate for the organization's uses.  These uses will change over time.

The ecosystem that supplies and uses this data/metadata must evolve and adapt to the changing and growing needs of the organization because trust is required not just for today's operation but also into the future.

You can make your own choices on how to build trust in your data/metadata.  Egeria provides *standards*, *mechanisms* and *practices* built from industry experiences and best practices that help in the maintenance of data/metadata:

* Egeria defines a standard format for storing metadata.  This includes an extendable type system so that any type of metadata that you need can be supported.

* Egeria provides technology to manage, store, distribute this standardized metadata.  This technology is inherently distributed, enabling you to work across multiple cloud platforms, data centres and other distributed environments. Collectively, a deployment of this technology is referred to as the *open metadata ecosystem*.

* Egeria provides connector interfaces to allow third party technology to plug into the open metadata ecosystem.  These connectors translate metadata from the third party technology's native format to the open metadata format.  This allows:
  
  * Collaboration
  * Blending automation and manual processes
  * Comprehensive security and privacy controls

* Egeria's documentation provides guidance on how to use this technology to deliver business value.

In this dojo we will cover these mechanisms and practices, showing how they fit in the metadata update specification pattern described above.  You can then select which are appropriate to your organization and when/where to consider using them.
