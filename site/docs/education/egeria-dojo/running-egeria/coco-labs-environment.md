The final session in day one of the Egeria Dojo is to use our Kubernetes helm charts to set up the infrastructure for Egeria's hands on labs.  These labs attempt to show a rich metadata environment in action, allowing you to experiment with different concepts and APIs.

First, delete the Helm chart you used in the last part of the tutorial.
```console
$ helm delete base
```

Now go to the [Open Metadata Labs](/egeria-docs/education/open-metadata-labs/overview) and follow the instructions for setting up the lab environment using Kubernetes.
Once it is running, go to the instructions to start the first lab notebook.

There is more material to run in the Open metadata Labs than can be done in 30 minutes. The purpose of this session is to ensure that you can set up the environment so you can run it at you leisure when every you want to.

In addition, these labs (like everything else in Egeria) is evolving rapidly so it is worth checking back from time to time to see what is new.
