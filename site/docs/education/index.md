# Learning about Egeria

--8<-- "snippets/getting-started.md"

Egeria is a big project tackling a complex problem.  There is a lot to learn. The choices below give you the opportunity to target your learning to both your immediate and long term needs. 

## The Egeria Dojos

Our dojos are designed to provide guided learning to help you get up to speed quickly with different topics.

We are currently in the process of rewriting our Dojos. There are three dojos available:

* [Day 1](/education/egeria-dojo/running-egeria/running-egeria-intro) - How to run Egeria.
* [Day 2](/education/egeria-dojo/developer/overview) - How to build connectors and utilities that use Egeria.
* [Day 3](/education/egeria-dojo/metadata-governance/overview) - How to manage and maintain yor metadata.

You can still also see the [Original Egeria Dojo](/getting-started/egeria-dojo), but it is not recommended that you rely on it since it is no longer tested.  Instead, look for future days of the updated dojo.

## Hands on Labs

The [Hands on Open Metadata Labs](/education/open-metadata-labs/overview) provide an interactive environment that allow you to experiment with different capabilities of Egeria.  They are organized by role so you can select the roles of interest to you.

## Individual tutorials

The individual tutorials focus on a specific tool, or group of related tasks.  They allow you to pick the education needed for a specific task.

- [Git and GitHub](/education/tutorials/git-and-git-hub-tutorial/overview)
- [Using IntelliJ](/education/tutorials/intellij-tutorial/overview)
- [Using Kubernetes](/guides/operations/kubernetes)
- [Using Docker](/education/tutorials/docker-tutorial/overview)
- [Using Postman](/education/tutorials/postman-tutorial/overview)
- [Using Kafka](/education/tutorials/kafka-tutorial/overview)
- [Building Egeria](/education/tutorials/building-egeria-tutorial/overview)
- [Working with Egeria's Clients](/education/tutorials/omag-client-tutorial)
- [Working with OMAG Servers](/education/tutorials/omag-server-tutorial/overview)
- [Running Egeria's Samples](/education/tutorials/running-samples-tutorial)
- [Testing Egeria](/education/tutorials/testing-egeria-tutorial)

## Technology comparisons

Sometimes it is useful to learn about a new technology by understanding how it compares to one you are familiar with.  The technology comparisons can be used to map Egeria's functions to the functions of another technology that you might be familiar with.

- [Apache Atlas comparison](/education/comparisons/apache-atlas)

## Webinars

[Egeria's webinars](/education/webinar-program/overview) run each month and provide a deep dive into a particular topic.  All webinars are recorded and are available on YouTube.
