# Downloading and Building Egeria Tutorial

Egeria is an open source project that is delivered both as source code as well as [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/) libraries.

This tutorial will guide you through the process of downloading the core Egeria source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/) and building it so that you can run it on your local machine.  

Alternatively you can also use [Kubernetes](/guides/operations/kubernetes) to run Egeria.  This uses the published builds of Egeria and does not require you to build Egeria on your machine.
