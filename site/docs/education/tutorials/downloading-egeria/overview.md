# Downloading Egeria

Egeria is an open source project that can be:

* Downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/odpi/egeria) and built to create your own customized version of Egeria.
* Used directly from a prebuilt docker image from either [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/odpi/egeria) or [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/odpi/egeria)

!!! tip "For developers wishing to contribute to Egeria"
    Contributions to Egeria need to be made via a Pull Request (PR) from you own fork of the project.  There are detailed instructions on how to do this in the [Git and GitHub Tutorial](/education/tutorials/git-and-git-hub-tutorial)

## Downloading Egeria from GitHub

There are two ways to download Egeria from GitHub:

* Directly from the website
* Using git commands from your laptop

The second approach is faster, but requires [git to be installed on your machine](/education/tutorials/git-and-git-hub-tutorial/overview/#installing-git-on-your-local-machine) which is worthwhile doing if you are anticipating downloading Egeria frequently.
