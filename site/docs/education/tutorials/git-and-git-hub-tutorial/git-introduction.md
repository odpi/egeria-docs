Git is an open source version control system.  The Egeria project uses git to:

- Store the source code, documentation and other file-based resources.
- Track changes to the underlying Egeria code as the project evolves
- Track issues and enhancements, and link these back to the code changes that resolve them
- Collaborate on and review the issues, enhancements and code changes

As a result, it gives us a definitive source for the latest and greatest source code for Egeria itself, its history, and the rationale behind various decisions that are made over time.
