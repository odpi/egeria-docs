### Creating an Issue on GitHub

Every contribution begins with a `git issue`.
Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/odpi/egeria) and click on the second tab marked `Issues`.

----

issue is displayed.

----

Enter a meaningful title and description.  This will help the maintainers understand your contribution
and speed up the process to include it.

Notice that it is possible to use [Markdown](/guides/contributor/markdown)
tags to create highlights and links to content to explain what you are doing.

When you are happy with your text, click on `Submit new Issue`.  A new issue is created and
assigned a new number - `#3091` in this example.
Make a note of this issue number because you will need it later.
