# OMAG Server Platform Tutorial

The [Open Metadata and Governance (OMAG) Server Platform](/concepts/omag-server-platform)
is a flexible server platform that
can run many different types of open metadata and governance services.

## Objectives

At the end of this tutorial you will be able to perform the following tasks.

* Starting the OMAG Server Platform
* Using the Administration Services to:
  * Configure open metadata and governance services in **OMAG servers**.
  * Start up the configured services.
  * Make calls to the running services.
  * Shutdown running services.
  * Remove the configuration for open metadata and governance services.
  
## Prerequisite Tasks

* [Download and build Egeria](../building-egeria-tutorial)
