# Egeria's solutions

Egeria's solutions provide capabilities that you can use immediately in your organization to solve common data exploitation and governance challenges.

For example, the solutions under [Leveraging your Estate](/egeria-solutions/leveraging-your-estate) help you survey and analyse existing deployments of systems, data pipelines and platforms to help you identify where the value lies and hence the places to focus your investment.  

We know change is inevitable.  But how do you make your organization more *evolvable* to meet the challenges created by change.  [Evolving to the Future](/egeria-solutions/evolving-to-the-future) provides capabilities and techniques that helps accelerate the communication of ideas through the capture of requirements and the implementation approach, people and activities, creating a rich context that links to the metadata for your estate (IT landscape).  New insight is now possible, and the organization is better prepared to meet the challenges of the future.  

Knowledge not only brings power, but it enables informed decisions.  As you work with Egeria, you are building a knowledge graph that transcends the silos in your organization created by team structure, and technology use.  With the [Accelerating Insight](/egeria-solutions/accelerating-insight) solutions, Egeria mines your knowledge graph and publishes the results as data products that can be subscribed to and monitored.  These insights highlight who is involved, how time and events affect your data, and enable the wisdom and automation powers of Egeria to be consumed by AI.

Finally, safety is everyone's concern in today's world.  Out-of-the-box, Egeria protects your knowledge graph with sophisticated security mechanisms.  The [Keeping Safe](/egeria-solutions/keeping-safe) solutions enhanced your security defences by managing user information and secrets to put them where they need to be, and nowhere else.
