# Leveraging your Open APIs

--8<-- "snippets/work-in-progress.md"

REST APIs can be defined using the Open API Specification standard.  Runtimes like Egeria's [OMAG Server Platform](/concepts/omag-server-platform) can publish their API specification either as a document or through its REST API.   The *Leveraging Open APIs* supports automatic cataloguing of APIs through its Open API Specification.
