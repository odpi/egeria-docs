# Leveraging your estate

The solutions under *Leveraging your estate* survey and analyse existing deployments of data pipelines and platforms to help you identify where the value lies and hence the places to focus your investment.

![Leveraging your estate](leveraging-your-estate.svg)

So if you are, for example, looking to move key data and pipelines from a legacy platform to a modern platform, the survey reports will highlight the types of data, when it was created, its last access and use in the legacy platform.

With the insight from the surveys, these solutions allow you to selectively catalog the valuable digital resources.  This may be the first time these resources have been catalogued, or there may be an existing metadata catalog that can be mined, augmented and updated with new definitions and lineage showing the downstream use of the legacy data.

Often the legacy platform will continue to run in parallel, delivering value to the organization.  The cataloguing/synchronizing process is therefore ongoing and covers structural information about the infrastructure, pipeline implementations and data stores along with the dynamic information about its operation such as lineage.

As more systems and data platforms are surveyed and catalogued, a clearer picture of your organization emerges, showing how the silos interact and depend on one another. 

Now you can plan for the future...
