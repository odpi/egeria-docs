# Egeria features

The Egeria features describe the value-add features that Egeria adds to its ability to synchronize metadata between different tools and catalogues.

- [Anchor Management](anchor-management/overview.md) - grouping metadata elements into larger objects so that they can share a common lifecycle.
- [Cohort Operation](cohort-operation/overview.md) - How does an open metadata repository cohort work.
- [Discovery and Stewardship](discovery-and-stewardship/overview.md) - automated metadata discovery and stewardship of results.
- [Duplicate Management](duplicate-management/overview.md) - linking metadata elements that represent the same [resource](/concepts/resource) so that these duplicates are automatically merged and do not bloat metadata query results.
- [Effectivity Dating](effectivity-dates/overview.md) - adding an optional start and end date to metadata elements to limit *when* they can be returned on a metadata query.
- [External Identifiers](external-identifiers/overview.md) - attaching the identifiers that metadata elements are know as in external tools and platforms to make it easier to match metadata from each system when synchronizing metadata.
- [External References](external-references/overview.md) - enriching metadata elements with links to related external material.
- [Governance Zones](governance-zoning/overview.md) - grouping [assets](/concepts/asset) that have similar uses and/or governance requirements into governance zones. The assets in a zone can be queried and managed as a group.
- [Incident Reporting](incident-reporting/overview.md) - reporting and managing the actions associated with a detected incident or issue relating to a metadata element or associated [resource](/concepts/resource).
- [Integrated Cataloguing](integrated-cataloguing/overview.md) - using automation to automatically synchronize metadata between Egeria and external tools and platforms.
- [Lineage Management](lineage-management/overview.md) - Tracing the origin and uses of resources in the organization.
- [Metadata Archiving](metadata-archiving/overview.md) - capturing and storing metadata into archives for backups or to share standard definitions between organizations or independently deployed metadata ecosystem.
- [Metadata Provenance](metadata-provenance/overview.md) - maintaining the origin of each metadata element.
- [Metadata Security](metadata-security/overview.md) - ensuring metadata elements are only visible to/editable by the appropriate consumers.
- [Open Type System](open-type-system/overview.md) - managing your own open metadata types.
- [People, Roles and Organizations](people-roles-organizations/overview.md) - how to synchronize information about people, what they do and how they are organized with Egeria to support security, collaboration, escalations and delegations.
- [Reference Data Management](reference-data-management/overview.md) - how to synchronize code values and other types of reference data across your systems.
- [Synchronized Access Control](synchronized-access-control/overview.md) - how to use metadata to maintain security information used to secure access to [digital resources](/concepts/resource).
- [Templated Cataloguing](templated-cataloguing) - using existing metadata elements as templates when cataloguing new [resources](/concepts/resource).
- [User Feedback](user-feedback/overview.md) - opening up the communication between [resource](/concepts/resource) owners and resource consumers.
