When a new resource is catalogued, the catalog entry of a similar resource can be used as a template to set up the asset for the new resource.  This means that the new asset can contain governance metadata attachments, not just the technical metadata extracted from the digital resource.

Templated cataloguing is useful for situations where new resources are regularly catalogued that are of the same kind.
