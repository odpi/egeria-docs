A *provisioning governance action service* invokes a provisioning service whenever a provisioning request is made. Typically, the provisioning service is an external service or pipeline. The provisioning governance action service may also create [lineage metadata](/features/lineage-management/overview) to describe the provisioning if this is not performed by another service.
