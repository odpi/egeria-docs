## Configure the audit log

Egeria's [audit log](/concepts/audit-log) provides a configurable set of destinations for audit records and other diagnostic logging for an [OMAG Server](/concepts/omag-server). Some destinations also support a query interface to allow an administrator to understand how the server is running.

If the server is a development or test server, then the default audit log configuration is probably sufficient: the console audit log destination.

!!! post "POST - set default audit log destination"
    ```
    {{platformURLRoot}}/open-metadata/admin-services/users/{{adminUserId}}/servers/{{serverName}}/audit-log-destinations/default
    ```

    Using this option overrides all previous audit log destinations.

If this server is a production server then you will probably want to set up the audit log destinations explicitly. You can add multiple destinations and each one can be set up to process specific severities of log records. The audit log severities are as follows:

| Severity | Description |
|---|---|
| `Information` | The server is providing information about its normal operation. |
| `Event` | An event was received from another member of the open metadata repository cohort. |
| `Decision` | A decision has been made related to the interaction of the local metadata repository and the rest of the cohort. |
| `Action` | An Action is required by the administrator. At a minimum, the situation needs to be investigated and if necessary, corrective action taken. |
| `Error` | An error occurred, possibly caused by an incompatibility between the local metadata repository and one of the remote repositories. The local repository may restrict some of the metadata interchange functions as a result. |
| `Exception` | An unexpected exception occurred. This means that the server needs some administration attention to correct configuration or fix a logic error because it is not operating as a proper peer in the open metadata repository cohort. |
| `Security` | Unauthorized access to a service or metadata instance has been attempted. |
| `Startup` | A new component is starting up. |
| `Shutdown` | An existing component is shutting down. |
| `Asset` | An auditable action relating to an asset has been taken. |
| `Types` | Activity is occurring that relates to the open metadata types in use by this server. |
| `Cohort` | The server is exchanging registration information about an open metadata repository cohort that it is connecting to. |
| `Trace` | This is additional information on the operation of the server that may be of assistance in debugging a problem. It is not normally logged to any destination, but can be added when needed. |
| `PerfMon` | This log record contains performance monitoring timing information for specific types of processing. It is not normally logged to any destination, but can be added when needed. |
| `<Unknown>` | Uninitialized Severity |

!!! tip "The body of the request should be a list of severities"
    If an empty list is passed as the request body then all severities are supported by the destination.

### Add audit log destinations

There are various destinations that can be configured for the audit log:

=== "console"

    !!! post "POST - add console audit log destination"
        This writes selected parts of each audit log record to stdout.

        ```
        {{platformURLRoot}}/open-metadata/admin-services/users/{{adminUserId}}/servers/{{serverName}}/audit-log-destinations/console
        ```

=== "slf4j"

    !!! post "POST - add slf4j audit log destination"
        This writes full log records to the slf4j ecosystem.

        ```
        {{platformURLRoot}}/open-metadata/admin-services/users/{{adminUserId}}/servers/{{serverName}}/audit-log-destinations/slf4j
        ```

        When configuring slf4j as destination you also need to specify audit log logger category via the application properties. This is described in [Connecting the OMAG Audit Log Framework](/guides/admin/omag-server-platform-logging/#connecting-the-omag-audit-log-framework) section of the developer logging guide.

=== "file"

    !!! post "POST - add JSON file-based audit log destination"
        This writes JSON files in a shared directory.

        ```
        {{platformURLRoot}}/open-metadata/admin-services/users/{{adminUserId}}/servers/{{serverName}}/audit-log-destinations/files
        ```

=== "event"

    !!! post "POST - add event-based audit log destination"
        This writes each log record as an event on the supplied event topic. It assumes that the [event bus](#set-up-the-default-event-bus) is set up first.

        ```
        {{platformURLRoot}}/open-metadata/admin-services/users/{{adminUserId}}/servers/{{serverName}}/audit-log-destinations/event-topic
        ```

=== "connection"

    !!! post "POST - add connection-based audit log destination"
        This sets up an audit log destination that is described though a [connection](/concepts/connection). In this case, the connection is passed in the request body and the supported severities can be supplied in the connection's configuration properties.

        ```
        {{platformURLRoot}}/open-metadata/admin-services/users/{{adminUserId}}/servers/{{serverName}}/audit-log-destinations/connection
        ```

=== "list"

    !!! post "POST - add a list of connection-based audit log destinations"
        It is also possible to set up the audit log destinations as a list of connections.
        Using this option overrides all previous audit log destinations.

        ```
        {{platformURLRoot}}/open-metadata/admin-services/users/{{adminUserId}}/servers/{{serverName}}/audit-log-destinations
        ```

### Remove audit logs

The following will remove all audit log destinations:

!!! post "POST - clear all audit log destinations"
    Clears the list of audit log destinations from the configuration enabling you to add a new set of audit log destinations.

    ```
    {{platformURLRoot}}/open-metadata/admin-services/users/{{adminUserId}}/servers/{{serverName}}/audit-log-destinations/none
    ```
