## Configure the workbenches

The workbenches are configured using the OMAG Server Platform Administration Services. This defines which workbenches to run and how to connect to the technology to test. This configuration defines an OMAG Server that will run the requested conformance suite tests.

Configure the OMAG Server that will run the requested conformance suite tests. The requested workbenches will begin to execute their tests as soon as the OMAG Server is started.

### Repository workbench

To run a metadata repository through the Repository Workbench, first configure a CTS server in the [OMAG Server Platform](/concepts/omag-server-platform) by configuring its general properties like server type, event bus, cohort, etc. Before starting the CTS server instance, configure the repository workbench within it using the following command:

!!! post "POST - configure repository workbench"
    ```
    {{platformURLRoot}}/open-metadata/admin-services/users/{{adminUserId}}/servers/cts/conformance-suite-workbenches/repository-workbench/repositories
    ```

    Send the repository workbench configuration as the request body, similar to the following:

    ```json hl_lines="3-5"
    {
      "class": "RepositoryConformanceWorkbenchConfig",
      "tutRepositoryServerName": "myserver",
      "testEntityTypes" : "Asset",
      "maxSearchResults": 5
    }    
    ```

    The required `tutRepositoryServerName` parameter defines the name of the repository server you wish to test, while the optional `maxSearchResults` parameter controls the sizing of the tests: both the number of instances the tests will attempt to create to carry out its tests and how extensive the search-based tests are.  The `testEntityTypes` is also optional and is used to restrict the types of the instances tested to:

    * These listed entities and their super types.
    * Any relationships that have the selected entity types at both ends.
    * Any classifications that can be attached to the selected entity types.

    If `testEntityTypes` is either an empty list or not set, then all known types from the technology under test is tested.

!!! attention "Start the technology under test **after** the CTS server"
    This repository server to test (`myserver` in the example above) should be [configured and started](/guides/admin/configuring-a-metadata-access-store) **after** starting the CTS repository workbench instance. Once the CTS server instance is started it will wait for the technology under test (the server named by the `tutRepositoryServerName` parameter) to be up and running before then starting its suite of tests.

The OMAG Server also supports a REST API for querying the results of running the conformance suite tests.
These commands include:

- Retrieve the results from a single named workbench.
- Retrieve the results from all workbenches and test cases (beware that the response can be 100's of MB in size, and
  may overflow your JVM heap).
- Retrieve the results from all failed test cases.
- Retrieve the Ids of all test cases.
- Retrieve the results from a specific test cases (for example, iterating through the above call's response).
- Retrieve the names of all profiles.
- Retrieve the details of a single profile's results (for example, iterating through the above call's response).

!!! attention "The resulting reports can be large"
    Ensure the jvm running the CTS server has at least 1GB heap to avoid any Java heap errors.

The Open Metadata Conformance Suite also has a client called `OpenMetadataConformanceTestReport` that will retrieve the conformance report and all details. It will store a summarized report in `openmetadata_cts_summary.json`, and the full details of each profile and test case in `profile-details` and `test-cases` sub-directories, respectively. The client also outputs a summary of the test run.
