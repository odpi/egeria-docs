### Asynchronous dialog

Egeria uses the [LF AI & Data Slack community :material-slack:](https://lfaifoundation.slack.com/archives/C01F40J2XA8){ target=slack } to provide an ongoing dialogue between members. This creates a recorded discussion of design decisions and discussions that complement the project meetings.

Follow the link above and register with the LF AI & Data Slack service using your email address. Once signed in you can see all the active Slack channels.

!!! tip "The main Slack channel for the Egeria project is called `#egeria-discussion`"
    Additional channels are added from time to time as new workgroups and discussion topics are established. For Egeria these channel names will begin with `#egeria`. You can also view Slack channels from other LF AI & Data projects.

??? question "More information about Slack?"
    Slack is an instant messaging tool that allows multiple conversations to occur amongst the community members at any one time. Each conversation is called a *channel*. Channels can be set up for a specific event or have a long-term existence.

### Mailing list

The community tends to use the [mailing list :material-dock-window:](https://lists.lfaidata.foundation/g/egeria-technical-discuss/topics){ target=list } only for automated meeting reminders. We are best contacted through Slack (above).

### Other websites and resources

- [Webinars :material-github:](https://github.com/odpi/data-governance/tree/master/webinars){ target=gh } - virtual events covering topics of interest.
- [Workshops :material-github:](https://github.com/odpi/data-governance/tree/master/workshops){ target=gh } - face-to-face workshops promoting discussion and education on Egeria
- [Presentations :material-github:](https://github.com/odpi/data-governance/tree/master/presentations){ target=gh } - presentations given at conferences and private gatherings

## Git repositories

The Egeria project uses [GitHub :material-github:](https://github.com/odpi){ target=gh } to maintain its content across a number of repositories.

All of these repositories are publicly visible; however, if you want to contribute new content you need to create a GitHub account.  This can be created from the top of the GitHub home page.

If you are not familiar with Git and GitHub, there is additional education in the
[developer-resources/tools :material-github:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/blob/master/developer-resources/tools/Git-GitHub.md){ target=gh } pages.

## Steps to contribute content to the project

Egeria uses [GitHub's fork and pull model :material-dock-window:](https://help.github.com/articles/about-collaborative-development-models/){ target=gh } to create a contribution. This process is described in detail in the [Egeria dojo education](/egeria-docs/getting-started/dojo/2/contribution-to-egeria).

Each change should have a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/issues) explaining why the change is being made. The new or updated content should follow the Egeria [developer guidelines](https://egeria.odpi.org/developer-resources/Developer-Guidelines).

There are additional resources for contributors under [developer-resources :material-github:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/tree/master/developer-resources){ target=gh }. Review the [developer guidelines :material-github:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/blob/master/developer-resources/Developer-Guidelines.md){ target=gh } to understand the requirements associated with new content for Egeria.

Every contribution is signed to say that the contributor has the rights to make the contribution and agrees with the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) :material-github:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/blob/master/developer-resources/why-the-dco.md){ target=gh }

### Creating a Linux Foundation account

The Linux Foundation provide build and distribution facilities. You need an account to access some of the reports from the build.

This is the link to create a [Linux Foundation account :material-dock-window:](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org){ target=lf }. Note the username and password you selected.
