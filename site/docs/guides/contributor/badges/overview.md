# Egeria badges

[Credly's Acclaim platform](https://info.credly.com/how-credly-works)
provides an employer agnostic authority
to hold your professional digital certifications and achievements.

The Egeria project is able to award two types of Acclaim
badges.  

* [Egeria Contributor](https://www.youracclaim.com/org/the-linux-foundation/badge/odpi-egeria-contributor) -
Earners of this badge are recognized by the Egeria maintainers as someone making a notable contribution to the
Egeria codebase or ecosystem growth.
