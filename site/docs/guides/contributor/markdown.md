# Markdown

Markdown is a simple tagging language that generates HTML webpages.
We use it for documentation (this page is written in markdown for example), in GitHub comments and
in the [Jupyter Notebooks](/education/tutorialsjupyter-tutorial/overview) that form the teaching material for the
[Hand-on Labs](/education/open-metadata-labs).

This summary for markdown is very useful

* [Markdown Syntax (from GitHub)](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)

Markdown files in the git repositories have a file type of `.md`.  Each directory in the repository
(except Java code packages) should have a README.md file in it explaining the content/purpose
of the directory.  This is the default page displayed for the directory.  For example,
click on this link to display the tools directory where this file lives on GitHub.

* [https://github.com/odpi/blob/main/site/docs/guides/contributor/markdown.md](https://github.com/odpi/blob/main/site/docs/guides/contributor/markdown.md)

Scroll to the bottom of the page to see the contents of the README.md displayed.

These pages are also used to create Egeria's web pages using a technology called **GitHub pages**.
Click on the next link to display the tools directory in the website.

* [https://odpi.github.io/guides/contributor/markdown](https://github.com/odpi/blob/main/site/docs/guides/contributor/markdown)

Now you see the same markdown content formatted using the website styling.
