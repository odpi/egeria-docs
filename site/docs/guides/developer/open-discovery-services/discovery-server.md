# Discovery server

The discovery server is the server environment that hosts one or more
[discovery engines](/concepts/open-discovery-engine).

In Egeria, the discovery server is implemented by the
[Asset Analysis](/services/omes/asset-analysis/overview) running in the
[Engine Host](/concepts/engine-host) OMAG Server.


## Further information

 * The [Discovery Engine OMAS](/services/omas/discovery-engine/overview)
   provides the metadata service for the discovery server.  It runs in
   either a [Metadata Access Point](/concepts/metadata-access-point)
   or a [Metadata Access Store](/concepts/metadata-access-store)
   Many discovery servers can use the same metadata server.
