# Writing Cohort Registry Store Connectors

The *cohort registry store* stores information about the repositories registered in the [open metadata repository cohort](/egeria-docs/services/omrs/cohort).  

Each server in the open metadata repository cohort has a [cohort registry](/egeria-docs/services/omrs/cohort/#cohort-registry) component to manage its registration with the cohort and maintain the contents of its local cohort registry store.

The following diagram shows a cohort with two members: notice that each server has its own cohort registry store - there is no central store.

The logical structure within the cohort registry store is as follows:

There is one local registration record describing the information sent to the other members of the cohort and a list of remote registration records received from the other members of the cohort.

An implementations of this type of connector is located in the
[adapters/open-connectors/repository-services-connectors/cohort-registry-store-connectors :material-github:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/tree/master/open-metadata-implementation/adapters/open-connectors/repository-services-connectors/cohort-registry-store-connectors){ target=gh } module.
