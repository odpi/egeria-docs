# Templates

[Templates](/concepts/template) describe standard patterns of metadata elements to used to describe something in the real world.  For example, a database is described using a [Database](/types/2/0224-Databases) type of asset metadata element.  Attached to the asset may be [Connection](/concepts/connection), which provides details of the connector used to access it, the schema structure and various classifications that describe how it is to be governed.  Without a template, each of these elements need to be added and linked to the other elements.

Templates can be used both by people performing manual curation of digital resources, and automated processes.  They simplify the process of cataloguing and increase the value and consistency of the resulting catalog entries.

Egeria includes template definitions for popular technologies in its content packs.  It is worth reviewing them and making any additions/updates needed to match the needs of your organization before loading any metadata to take full advantage of Egeria's templating capability.
