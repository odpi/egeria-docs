# Project Operations

The Egeria project provides content (standards, data, code and documentation) that is intended for wide consumption across many types of organizations: from those that rely on data in their operation, to organizations that have products or technology designed to help manage data and its related processing.

A project of this scope requires input from a wide range of subject matter experts with different backgrounds and allegiances. As such, we need a set of principles, roles and operating practices to ensure the results of our contributions are useful, have high quality and are widely consumable.

## General principles

The principles set the tone of the operation of Egeria:

- The activities of the project ensure open collaboration. Through this open collaboration we aim to build a community of people who are interested in the success of the project.
- The scope of the content is determined by the individuals who are actively contributing.
- The resulting content is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
- An individual's privileges and position is awarded through their contribution and engagement.

These principles should be respected as the procedures used to manage the Egeria project are evolved and matured.

## Community members

Anyone can become a *member* of the Egeria community by signing up to the Egeria mailing list, joining the Slack community, attending the project online meetings or contributing content to one of more of the GitHub repositories.

The [community guide](community.md) describes how to connect to these channels.

All participants in the Egeria community are bound by the project's [Code of Conduct :material-github:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md){ target=gh }.

As a member you are able to attend our meetings, just to listen, or to play an active part in the discussion. The online meetings are recorded to allow community members to catch up if they are not able to attend the live meeting. When you attend the community meetings specifically, your name will be recorded in the meeting minutes along with any remarks or suggestions you make. The agenda and minutes of our community meetings are publicly available on the [Egeria wiki :material-dock-window:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/wiki){ target=gh }.

A member may make contributions to the Egeria content by submitting a GitHub pull request on the appropriate Git repository. This will be reviewed and processed by the [Egeria maintainers](#maintainers). The process for making a contribution is described in the [Egeria Dojo](/getting-started/dojo/introduction) education. Each contribution is signed-off by the contributor to confirm they agree to our [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](/guides/contributor/guidelines/#sign-commits-to-accept-dco).

Community members can progress to be Egeria [contributors](#contributors) and then Egeria [maintainers](#maintainers).

### Contributors

Egeria *contributors* are members who have actively taken additional steps to promote and foster the success of Egeria and its acceptance/adoption across the IT community. The activities that contributors engage in might include:

- Provide best practices for information governance, lineage, metadata management and other related disciplines during active discussions and/or development of material.
- Actively participate in meetings and discussions
- Promote the goals of Egeria and the benefits of open metadata to the IT community (deliver presentations, informal talks, assist at trade shows, independent blogs, etc.)
- Assist in the recruitment of new members.
- Contribute where appropriate to documentation and code reviews, specification development, demonstration assets and other artifacts that help move Egeria forward.
- Being a defined contributor will also give you greater access to the Egeria repositories where you can assign/be assigned issues and reviews.

!!! tip "How to become a contributor"
    Being recognized as an Egeria contributor is done by nomination of an Egeria maintainer with a majority vote of Egeria maintainers to confirm. 

    A person wishing to become a contributor may send a note to the existing mailing list at egeria-technical-discuss@lists.lfaidata.foundation, listing their Egeria contributions to date and requesting to be made a contributor.

    A maintainer can then propose this and the other maintainers will review. They will look for participation in the community.

    If agreed, you will receive [an Egeria Contributor badge :material-dock-window:](https://www.youracclaim.com/org/the-linux-foundation/badge/odpi-egeria-contributor){ target=credly } to add to your social profiles and/or website, and can publicly refer to yourself as an Egeria contributor.

!!! note "Contributor approval process"

    - A maintainer sends an email to other maintainers on the [egeria maintainers](https://lists.lfaidata.foundation/g/egeria-maintainers/messages) mailing list with subject beginning 'New Contributor Proposal' proposing the new contributor(s) and reasons why. (this list is private to Egeria maintainers).
    - maintainers should vote and reply promptly to the email thread with a clear YES/NO along with further comments.
    - votes should be done within 7 days.
    - Voting is by simple majority.
    - If approved, a github admin will add the new contributor to :
        - /CONTRIBUTORS.md in the egeria repository
        - The odpi github organization 'Egeria Contributors' team, which grants 'read' access to our repositories. ([admin](https://github.com/orgs/odpi/teams/egeria-contributors))


Egeria's contributors are recognized in the [contributors list :material-github:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md){ target=gh }

### Maintainers

*Maintainers* are members of the Egeria community that have permission to change the Egeria content. This may be content that they have created themselves, or has been provided by another member. Maintainers also have responsibility for helping other project members with their contributions. This includes:

There are two kinds of maintainers
 - 'local maintainers' - these have extra permissions & shared ownership of specific repositories. They are not eligible to take part in a maintainer vote.
 - 'full maintainers' - these have permissions across all repos, and are regarded as maintainers for voting purposes

- Monitoring email aliases.
- Monitoring Slack (delayed response is perfectly acceptable).
- Triage GitHub issues and perform pull request reviews for other maintainers and the community.
- Make sure that ongoing git pull requests are moving forward at the right pace or closing them.
- In general continue to be willing to spend at least 25% of one's time working on the project (approximately 1.25 business days per week).
- Sustained contributions

!!! tip "How to become a maintainer"
    New maintainers are voted onto the maintainers list by [the existing maintainers :material-github:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md){ target=gh }.

    A person wishing to become a maintainer sends a note to the existing mailing list at egeria-technical-discuss@lists.lfaidata.foundation, listing their Egeria contributions to date and requesting to be made a maintainer. They should also confirm if the proposal is for a local maintainer (in which case list relevant repositories), or full maintainer.

    If agreed, and for full maintainers only, you will receive an [an Egeria Maintainer badge :material-dock-window:](https://www.youracclaim.com/org/the-linux-foundation/badge/odpi-egeria-maintainer){ target=credly } to add to your social profiles and/or website, and can publicly refer to yourself as an Egeria maintainer.

!!! note "Maintainer approval process"

    - Whilst some initial comments may be made on the technical list, the main voting should take place on our maintainer email list.
    - An existing maintainer sends an email to other maintainers on the [egeria maintainers](https://lists.lfaidata.foundation/g/egeria-maintainers/messages) mailing list with subject beginning 'New Maintainer Proposal' proposing the new maintainer(s) and reasons why. (this list is private to Egeria maintainers).
    - maintainers should vote and reply promptly to the email thread with a clear YES/NO along with further comments.
    - votes should be done within 7 days.
    - Voting is by simple majority.
    - If approved, an admin will add a full maintainer to:
        - /MAINTAINERS.md in the egeria repository
        - The 'Egeria Maintainers' team in the odpi github organization, which grants 'maintain' access to our repositories. ([admin](https://github.com/orgs/odpi/teams/egeria-maintainers))
        - the 'maintainers' mailing list ([admin](https://lists.lfaidata.foundation/g/egeria-technical-discuss/sendinvites))
    - For local maintainers they will be added to an appropriate group on odpi github to provide admin permissions on selected repositories only.


!!! attention "Losing maintainer status"
    If a maintainer is no longer interested or cannot perform the maintainer duties listed above, they should volunteer to be moved to emeritus status. In extreme cases this can also occur by a vote of the maintainers per the voting process below. Emeritus maintainers can rejoin the maintainer list through a vote of the existing maintainers.

### Leadership

The leadership of Egeria is granted through a vote of the Egeria maintainers. Egeria is currently led by Mandy Chessell.

## Project meetings

Some meetings are face-to-face, but most are conference calls. Attendance at meetings is open to all. Conference calls can be joined without an explicit invitation. However, due to physical security requirements at some venues we use, it is necessary to ensure you are added to the invitee list of any face-to-face meetings that you wish to attend and complete the necessary formalities for the venue.

For example, the face-to-face meeting may be at a conference that requires you to register for the conference to attend, or a meeting may be at an organization's offices that are required to maintain a list of everyone on site.

!!! tip "See details in the [community guide](/guides/community)"
    Refer to the [community guide](/guides/community) for further details on the specific meetings that are planned, conference call links and dial-in numbers, as well as other communications channels like Slack and email.

## Releases

The Egeria team aim to create an official release of the open metadata and governance capability every month. This release will be available to include in products and other technology through [Maven's Central Repository :material-dock-window:](https://search.maven.org){ target=mc }, or through a download from the GitHub site. Details of the releases are maintained in the [release notes](/release-notes/overview).

In between official releases, the latest build is also available to developers in GitHub.

The process for creating a release is described in the [contributors' guide](/guides/contributor/release-process)

## Conflict resolution and voting

In general, we prefer that technical issues and maintainer membership are amicably worked out between the persons involved. If a dispute cannot be decided independently, the maintainers can be called in to decide an issue. If the maintainers themselves cannot decide an issue, the issue will be resolved by voting. The voting process is a simple majority in which each maintainer receives one vote.
