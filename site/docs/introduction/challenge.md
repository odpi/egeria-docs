# The challenge

Every week we hear of new tools, data platforms and opportunities for organizations to
embrace advanced digital technologies such as artificial intelligence. Yet despite investment
and the focus of smart people, few organizations succeed in making wide and systematic use of
their data.

Today's IT is at the heart of the problem. Many tools and data platforms recognize the value
of metadata, but manage it in a siloed, proprietary way that assumes they are the only
technology employed by the organization. The result is that knowledge is not shared between
people that use different tool sets.

**Egeria is an open source project dedicated to making metadata open and automatically
exchanged between tools and platforms, no matter which vendor they come from.**

## Open metadata and governance manifesto

Our guiding beliefs:

- The maintenance of metadata must be automated to scale to the sheer volumes and variety of
  data involved in modern business. Similarly, metadata should be used to drive the governance
  of data and create a business-friendly logical interface to the data landscape.
- The availability of metadata management must become ubiquitous in cloud platforms and large
  data platforms, such as Apache Hadoop, so that the processing engines on these platforms can
  rely on its availability and build capability around it.
- Metadata access must become open and remotely accessible so that tools from different
  vendors can work with metadata located on different platforms. This implies unique
  identifiers for metadata elements, some level of standardization in the types and formats
  for metadata and standard interfaces for manipulating metadata.
- Wherever possible, discovery and maintenance of metadata has to be an integral part of all
  tools that access, change and move information.

    Egeria provides an Apache 2.0 licensed platform to support vendors that sign up to the open metadata and governance manifesto.
