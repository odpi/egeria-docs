The `extendedProperties` and `typeName` properties provide a means to maintain the properties of elements that are [subtypes of the types](/concepts/open-metadata-type-definitions) supported directly on the API.

In order to create or update the properties of a subtype, set the `typeName` property to the name of the type for the element.  Then add the properties that are supported by the subtypes into the extended properties.
