The external source identifiers, `externalSourceGUID` and `externalSourceName` are used to set up an [external metadata collection](/concepts/metadata-collection) for new metadata elements.  Update and delete requests use the same identifiers to indicate they belong to the same "system" and have rights to chang it.
