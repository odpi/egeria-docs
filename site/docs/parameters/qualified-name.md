Metadata instances that inherit from the [`Referenceable`](/types/0/0010-Base-Model/#referenceable) type have a property called `qualifiedName`. This is a unique name for the instance. When such an instance is created, the qualified name can be a unique identifier that is a natural unique name for the resource that it represents (such as the full path name of a file) or a unique identifier from an external system or tool. The element can then be retrieved using the `qualifiedName`.
