# Harvest and Publish

--8<-- "snippets/work-in-progress.md"

The open metadata ecosystem collects valuable reference data about your organization's operation as a result of its activities.  This reference data has value beyond the open metadata ecosystem.  

The *Harvest and Publish* pattern simplifies the process of sharing this data with other systems and tools in use by your organization.  It includes:

* A Harvester (called the *Jacquard Digital Product Loom*) that creates a digital product catalog from the open metadata it finds in the open metadata ecosystem.
* A subscription manager called *Baudot Subscription Manager* that supports the creating and managing of subscriptions to the catalog.  This includes issuing notifications to subscribers.
* A distribution pipeline called the *Wedgwood Product Reproducer* that copies product data into destinations supplied by the subscribers.

Together they create a flexible and scalable solution for sharing the valuable reference data that is generated by the open metadata ecosystem.
