# Egeria's Patterns of Use


Egeria provides unified capabilities that can be configured together in various ways to solve problems for your organization.  The pages below are in no way exhaustive, but they aim to show common patterns of use.  These patterns are used extensively in [Egeria's solutions](/egeria-soutions).

[Egeria as a Metadata Manager](/patterns/metadata-manager/overview) shows a tradition role of a metadata catalog, describing the [digital resources](/concepts/digital-resource) used by your organization.  It shows how the basic technical metadata that can be extracted from digital resources can be enhanced with additional metadata that improves understanding and manageability of these digital resources.

[Metadata Engagement](/patterns/metadata-engagement/overview) provides no-code services for subject matter experts and data users.

[Metadata Exchange](/patterns/metadata-exchange/overview) describes the automation mechanisms for capturing and managing metadata.  The aim is to create interoperable metadata that drives up the value of your tools and teams.

[Metadata Governance](/patterns/metadata-governance/overview) supports [governance actions](/concepts/governance-action) for validating, augmenting, linking and deduping your metadata.

[Metadata Harvester](/patterns/metadata-harvester/overview) supports automated notification and digital product management with active subscriptions, agreements and data delivery.  It includes a digital product marketplace that is automatically populated with interesting digital products harvested from the open metadata ecosystem.

[Metadata Insight](/patterns/metadata-insight/overview) monitors the open metadata ecosystem to produce analysis of activity and metadata to create insight into who is delivering value, where it occur, the size of different aspect of your estate and trends associated with your operation.  These insights are captured in the digital product marketplace introduced in the **Metadata Harvester** pattern.
