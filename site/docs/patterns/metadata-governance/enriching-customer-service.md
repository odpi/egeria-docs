The managing director of the bus company picks up a changing perspective in the head office employees since the implementation of the bus timetable management process.  Rather than a focus on running the buses, there is a growing understanding that they are providing a service to their customers.

Eager to build on this change, the managing director encourages her employees to bring forward ideas that increase their customer service.  These ideas include disseminating information about local events (along with information about to get to the event by bus, of course :)). 

As a result, the bus timetables began to include a calendar of local events.  Event organizers were able to register their events with the bus company and negotiate for additional buses where necessary.  New bus routes are identified and begin to operate.  The effect is that the bus company became an active member of the community, with increasing bus use and associated profits.
