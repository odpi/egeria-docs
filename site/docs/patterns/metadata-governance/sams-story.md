Sam bought a new house in a little village that was 10 miles from where he worked.  He is keen to live sustainably and was delighted to hear from his new neighbours that there was a good bus service that many of them used to get to work.

Sam stopped by the bus stop to look up the bus times for the next day.

Next morning he left in plenty of time.  He was surprised there was no-one there waiting for the bus.  No bus came for nearly an hour, making him late for work.  He asked the driver what happened to the earlier bus.  He said he was not aware there was any problem.

Once at work he called the bus company.  The clerk who answered the phone laughed and said that the timetable at the bus stop was out of date.  The local council required them to display a timetable so the one that was there was from last year.  It was ok because everyone knew the timetable.

Annoyed, Sam asked where he could get an up-to-date timetable for the bus.  The clerk did not know but suggested he call head office and was nice enough to give him with the telephone number.  It took a number of calls to find the right person, who then willingly dictated the times to him.  Sam asked how often the bus times changed and how he could keep up-to-date.  He was told that changes occurred infrequently and when they did, the bus driver would announce it.   Sam could also ring back to check for changes from time to time.
