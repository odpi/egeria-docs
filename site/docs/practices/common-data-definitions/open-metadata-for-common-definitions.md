# Open metadata for common data definitions

Egeria provides a comprehensive set of [open metadata types](/types) for managing [common data definitions](/practices/common-data-definitions/overview).  These types provide a common language and format for exchanging these definitions between tools and metadata repositories.  Each tool/repository provides a mapping to the Egeria types and Egeria manages the exchange of metadata between these parties.
