## Release 2.2 (September 2020)

Below are the highlights of this release:

 * Additional connectors are now placed in our assembly under platform/lib without dependencies. If you need to use a connector that requires additional dependencies that are not already part of the platform's classpath, you will need to add those libraries here.
 * The [docker](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/odpi/egeria/tags?page=1&name=2.2) image has been updated to use a later openjdk alpine base image due to incompatibilities with our JanusGraph support in the old images for java 8.
 * In the VDC chart, 2 new values have been added, 'ibmigc.connectorversion' and 'atlas.connectorversion'. In this release these are set to use the 2.1 connectors, since the connectors run to a different release cycle than the main Egeria code. Once new connectors are released you can update these values to get the latest connectors 
 * Additional code to support lineage has been added, but in this release it remains in development and is not yet ready for use in production.
 * User interface improvements.
 * Ongoing bug fixes and refactoring especially in subject-area omas.

### Known Issues
 * In the VDC helm chart, the Apache Atlas initialization job fails to complete. This is due to a problem with the Apache Atlas server and Apache SOLR. See https://github.com/odpi/egeria/issues/3587 for more information.

### Dependencies
 * Spring Boot is updated to 2.3.3.
