# Release 3.8 (May 2022)

* The [Egeria Ecosystem UI](/user-interfaces/ecosystem) has a new 'historical query' capability. You can now issue queries in the past and 
if the repository supports it you can work with Rex at a time in the past. See the [Repsotory Explorer user guide](/guides/ecosystem-ui/rex-user-guide) for how to use
  the repository explorer. 
  
Historical query is available in release [3.8.1](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/releases/tag/V3.8.1). 3.8 has a bug such that the Repository Explorer Explore button errors
in many scenarios.
