## Release 4.1 (29 May 2023)


??? functional "Open Metadata Types"
    * A new relationship [*SampleData*](/types/0/0010-Basic-Model) links an Asset entity describing a collection of sample data that originates from the resource represented by the Referenceable entity.
    * A new *sourceVersionNumber* attribute has been added to the [*SourcedFrom*](/types/0/0011-Managing-Referenceables) relationship type to allow the version of the element that is copied to be recorded.
    * A new classification called [*TemplateSubstitute*](/types/0/0011-Managing-Referenceables) has been added to isolate relationships included in templates from normal metadata queries.
    * A new classification called [*RootCategory*](/types/3/0320-Category-Hierarchy) has been added to identify *GlossaryCategory* entities that are the top of a category hierarchy.
    * The [*GlossaryTermEvolution*](/types/3/0385-Controlled-Glossary-Development) relationship has been deprecated.
    * New classifications *EditingGlossary* and *StagingGlossary* have been added to the [*0385*](/types/3/0385-Controlled-Glossary-Development) model to support the controlled glossary development process.
    * A new classification called [*DataFieldValues**](/types/2/0210-Data-Stores) allows the characterization of a collection of data values.
    * A new attribute called *publishVersionIdentifier* has been added to [GlossaryTerm](/types/3/0330-Terms) to allow authors to control the version of published terms.

??? functional "HMS listener"
    The [Hive Metastore (HMS) listener](/connectors/repository/hms/overview/#using-with-the-hive-metastore-listener) runs in the HMS process,
