## Release 4.3 (September 2023)

Release 4.3 continues the process of improving Egeria's usability.  These changes have some effect on backwards compatibility but will lead to a smoother experience in the long term.

??? warning "Change to the original Open Metadata Assembly"
    When the gradle build runs in the core egeria git repository (egeria.git), it creates an assembly of the Egeria runtimes. This is located in the `build` directory under `open-metadata-distributions/open-metadata-assemblies`.  In release 4.2, this assembly was updated to create a new directory called `platform` which held the runtime and libraries for the OMAG Server Platform.  The docker image for Egeria (and hence the helm charts) was updated so that it runs the platform from this new directory. The platform runtime was originally located in a directory called `server` which caused confusion.  The content of the `server` directory was not changed at that time.  However, in 4.3, the `server` directory now contains a new cloud native runtime for a single OMAG Server.  This is the structure you will see in 4.3.

??? functional "New assemblies for the OMAG Server Platform and Egeria UI Platform"
    The single assembly described above suffered from conflicts of runtime settings between the different runtimes. The result was a complex and less than obvious organization of the files.  There are new assemblies created during the core egeria build that are focused on a single runtime.  Their structure is simpler, making it more obvious which files/properties are controlling each runtime.  These assemblies are located under `open-metadata-distribution`.  Each assembly is created by its own module.  The `egeria-ui-application` module builds the an assembly for the Egeria UI Application.  This includes the certificates and property files used by this application. The OMAG Server Platform assembly is created by a module called `omag-server-platform`. It includes three main directories:

    * `platform` - The platform runtime.
    * `etc` - Utilities and reports.
    * `opt` - Optional content including sample metadata (loadable as an Open Metadata Archive), sample data, sample applications that call the Egeria APIs and postman collections

    The top level directory also includes a docker build configuration that packages files under the `platform` directory into a docker container and publishes it to your docker daemon.  Once egeria's grable build is complete, you can add and remove libraries and other content from the `platform` directory and then build your own customized docker container.

    Each directory in the assembly includes a README.md file to explain its contents.

??? warning "Database connectors are now in egeria.git"
    The JDBC database connectors are now located in the core Egeria git repository.  The [JDBC Resource Connector](/connectors/resource/jdbc-resource-connector) now includes helper functions when issuing simple SQL commands.

??? warning "Developer utilities are now in egeria.git"
    The utilities located in `egeria-dev-projects.git` are now located in `egeria.git` under the `open-metadata-resources` module.  They are now included automatically in the `omag-server-platform` assembly.  These utilities are used in the [Developer Dojo](/education/egeria-dojo/developer/overview).  This will be updated to use the new assembly once release 4.3 is shipped.

??? functional "Extended integration connector function"
    [Integration connectors](/concepts/integration-connector) can now check to see if they are in the middle of refresh() processing.  This is valuable in multi-threaded operation, for example when processing events.  Typically many of the events that are generated while the connector is being called to `refresh()` are caused by the connector's activity.  There is a new method on the integration context called [`isRefreshInProgress()`](https://odpi.github.io/egeria/org/odpi/openmetadata/frameworks/integration/context/IntegrationContext.html).  It returns true if the connector is currently running its `refresh()` method.  An example of how to use this method is found in the [developer guide](/guides/developer/integration-connectors/overview/#registering-a-listener-with-open-metadata).

??? functional "New configuration command for when a cohort member moves platform"
    Servers that are [members of a cohort](/concepts/cohort-member) regularly broadcast their network address to other members to allow them to dynamically configure their federated query support.  This network address is configured in the OMAG Server's [configuration document](/concepts/configuration-document) as the `localRepositoryRemoteConnection`'s endpoint address.  When an OMAG Server is relocated to a new platform, this address must change.  There is a new administration command called [`resetRemoteCohortURL`]() with URL `POST {platformURLRoot}/open-metadata/admin-services/users/{userId}/servers/{serverName}/local-repository/configuration/remote-repository-connector-url`.  The new URL is passed in the request body:

    ```json
    {
        "class": "URLRequestBody",
        "urlRoot": "{platformURLRoot}/servers/{serverName}"
    }
    ```

??? functional "Open Metadata Integration Services (OMISs) updates"
    * [Category Integrator OMIS](/services/omis/catalog-integrator/overview) supports the stewardship services from [Asset Manager OMAS](/services/omas/asset-manager/overview) through the [`StewardshipExchangeService`](https://odpi.github.io/egeria/org/odpi/openmetadata/integrationservices/catalog/connector/StewardshipExchangeService.html).
    * A number of fixes have been made to the context methods of the OMISs that were incorrectly exposing the `userId`, `externalSourceGUID` and `externalSourceName` parameters.  These have been corrected so these values come from the connector's configuration.  The affected OMISs are:

        * [Catalog Integrator OMIS](/services/omis/catalog-integrator/overview)
        * [Display Integrator OMIS](/services/omis/display-integrator/overview)
        * [Infrastructure Integrator OMIS](/services/omis/infrastructure-integrator/overview)
        * [Lineage Integrator OMIS](/services/omis/lineage-integrator/overview)
        * [Security Integrator OMIS](/services/omis/security-integrator/overview)

??? functional "Apache Atlas Integration Connector"
    The [Apache Atlas Integration Connector](/connectors/integration/apache-atlas-catalog-integration-connector) has been enhanced to catalog Assets and Lineage from Apache Atlas into the open metadata ecosystem.  

    A future version will maintain [semantic assignment](/types/3/0370-Semantic-Assignment) relationships between the glossary terms, exchanged in the first release of the connector, with the Apache Atlas assets it finds.

    Release 4.3 also extracted the java client from this connector and created a new [resource connector](/concepts/digital-resource-connector) for Apache Atlas.  The resulting [Apache Atlas REST Connector](/connectors/resource/apache-atlas-rest-connector) provides a Java API that calls the Apache Atlas REST API with no dependencies on Apache Atlas nor the Hadoop libraries it depends on.  This resource connector is used in the Apache Atlas Integration Connector and is intended for new connectors for Apache Atlas planned to be written for a future release.

??? functional "Conformance Test Suite"
    There is a new option on the repository workbench to allow you to restrict the number of different types of instances that are tested.  By default, all combinations of the types supported by the technology under test, are used when testing the instance methods.  For native repository connectors, that can add up to a lot of tests, taking many hours to run.  In 4.3, we have introduced a new option called *testEntityTypes* that is [added to the workbench configuration](/guides/admin/servers/configuring-a-conformance-test-server). It is set to a list of entity types such as `["Asset", "InformalTag"]` and the tests are restricted to these types, their super types and any relationships and classifications that can connector to these entity types. 

??? functional "Metadata Observability"
    There is a new [Audit log severity called ACTIVITY](/concepts/audit_log) that is used to report activity in the open metadata ecosystem.  This severity is used when logging messages about:

    * The REST API calls made by each user.
    * The requests to retrieve, create and maintain assets.

??? functional "Open Metadata Types"
    * The  [*HostClusterMember*](/types/0/0035-Complex-Hosts) relationship has new properties *memberRole* and *additionalProperties* to improve ability to describe a host cluster operation.
    * The  [*DataSet*](/types/0/0010-Base-Model), [*DataStore*](/types/2/0210-Data-Stores), [*DeployedAPI*](/types/2/0212-Deployed-APIs), [*DeployedSoftwareComponent*](/types/2/0215-Software-Components) and [*DataFeed*](/types/2/0223-Events-and-Logs) entity types each have a new attribute called *deployedImplementationType* to describe the technology supporting the associated component.  This addition is to enable integration connectors to be more precise in describing the technology they are cataloguing.  This attribute is also used in [*SoftwareServerPlatform*](/types/0037-Software-Server-Platforms), [*SoftwareServer*](/types/0/0040-Software-Servers) and [*SoftwareCapability*](/types/0/0042-Software-Capabilities) entity types; along with the [ServerPurpose](/types/0/0041-Server-Purpose) and [*CloudPlatform*](/types/0/0090-Cloud-Platforms-and-Services) classification.  There are subtypes of *DataStore* (*LogFile*, *GraphStore*, *MetadataRepository*) have been modified because they already include the property and duplicate properties in the type hierarchy cause indexing problems in some repositories.  Similarly, there were duplicated *deployedImplementationType* properties in the [*ServerPurpose*](/types/0/0041-Server-Purpose) classification affecting *RepositoryProxy* and *MetadataServer* classifications.
    * A new entity type called [*RelationalDatabase*](/types/2/0224-Databases) has been added to distinguish databases that follow the relational schema and can be accessed through JDBC.
    * The  [*Person*](/types/1/0112-People) entity type has a new attribute called *residentCountry* to describe the primary country of residence.  In addition, there is a new attribute called *timeZone* to describe the time zone of the location where this person is located.
