### Annual Project Review

The Egeria project annual review by the [Technical Advisory Board (TAC)](https://wiki.lfaidata.foundation/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=7733341) of the LF AI and Data foundation is scheduled for 15th December 2022.  Please encourage people who work with Egeria to *Star* each of our repositories on GitHub as we are trying to get [our total count to 1000](https://landscape.lfai.foundation/?selected=egeria).

### Moving to Gradle

Our build technology for the Java based projects has used both Maven and Gradle.  We plan to move entirely to gradle in the next few months, so you will see:

* Repositories such as egeria-dev-projects.git and egeria-samples.git move from maven to gradle.
* The Egeria Development Dojo will use gradle in the exercises.

The [Core Egeria](https://github.com/odpi/egeria) repository has offered both a maven and a gradle option.  The maven option will be removed once we are sure the gradle build is able to support the release process.
