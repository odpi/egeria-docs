# GAF Metadata Management

GAF metadata management provides the context services defined by the [Open Governance Framework (OGF)](/frameworks/ogf/overview) along with services that support the [Open Metadata Access Services (OMASs)](/services/omas):

* Open Metadata Store is a generic metadata interface.  It enables the searching for and retrieval of open metadata type definitions, plus the searching for, update and retrieval of all types of open metadata elements: entities, relationships and classifications.
* Open Governance Service supports the setting up of governance actions such as [governance action processes](/concepts/governance-action-process) and [governance action types](/concepts/governance-action-type), and the initiation of [engine actions](/concepts/engine-action) either directly or via a governance action process or governance action type.

It provides base clients for each of these services that are specialized by each OMAS to limit metadata access to its supported zones.
