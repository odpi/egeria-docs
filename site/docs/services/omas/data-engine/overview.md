# Data Engine Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS)

The Data Engine OMAS provides APIs and events for data movement/processing engines to record the changes made to the data landscape. 

It provides the ability to register the data engine itself along with the lineage details of the ETL transformations. 
Data Engine OMAS APIs offer support for creating the corresponding open metadata types for assets and jobs.

## Using te Data Engine Java Client
The Data Engine OMAS client interface supports the creation, update and delete of metadata entities and relationships.
More details about using the client and the implementations available can be found [here](de-client.md)

## Using the Data Engine OMAS REST API
Below is the list of endpoints supported by Data Engine OMAS.
Typically, the first action to take for an external tool is to register as an
[engine](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/software-capability/#engine).
