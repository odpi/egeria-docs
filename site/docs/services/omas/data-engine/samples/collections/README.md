# Samples

### [DataEngine-asset-endpoints.postman_collection.json](DataEngine-asset_endpoints.postman_collection.json)
This sample Postman collection illustrates DataEngine OMAS endpoints for creating/updating/deleting assets

### [DataEngine-process-endpoints.postman_collection.json](DataEngine-process_endpoints.postman_collection.json)
This sample Postman collection illustrates DataEngine OMAS endpoints for creating/updating/deleting processes

### [DataEngine-topics.postman_collection.json](DataEngine-topics-lineage_examples.postman_collection.json)
This sample Postman collection illustrates DataEngine OMAS endpoints for creating/updating/deleting topics


### [DataEngineOMAS-minimal-flows.postman_collection.json](Data%20Engine-minimal_flows_granular_level.postman_collection.json)
This sample Postman collection illustrates DataEngine OMAS endpoints used for creating column level lineage. It showcases the minimal flows example, composed of three lineage flows tht are connected.

Prerequisites:

- [local-integration-tests.postman_environment.json](local-integration-tests.postman_environment.json) - the environment used for running the tests locally

- Egeria by default uses https:// requests with a self-signed certificate. Any PostMan users therefore will need to
  go into settings->general and turn off 'SSL certificate verification' or requests will fail.

Each step is sequentially numbered so that they can be executed in-order as part of a Postman "Runner", if desired.
