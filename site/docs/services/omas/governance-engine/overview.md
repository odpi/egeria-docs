# Governance Engine Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS)

The *Governance Engine OMAS* supports the implementation of a [governance program](/services/omas/governance-program/overview) by providing the metadata services for defining and running [governance engines](#governance-engines) as well as setting up [integration groups](#integration-groups).

## Governance Engines

A governance engine is a collection of related *[governance services](/concepts/governance-service)* that provide pluggable governance functions.  The governance services are implemented as 
specialist [connectors](/frameworks/ocf/overview) that are defined by:

 * [Open Discovery Framework (ODF)](/frameworks/odf/overview) for Open Discovery Services
   that analyse the content of resources in the digital landscape.
 * [Governance Action Framework (GAF)](/frameworks/gaf/overview) of Governance Action Services
   that monitor, assess and maintain metadata.

The governance services run in the [Engine Host OMAG Server](/concepts/engine-host) supported by the [Open Metadata Engine Services (OMES)](/services/omes).  They are triggered via [governance actions](/concepts/governane-action).

The Governance Engine OMAS has the following capabilities to support governance engines:

Behind the scenes, Governance Engine OMAS handles the choreography of governance actions based on the process definition provided by a [governance action process](/concepts/governance-action-process).

!!! info "Further documentation"
    The documentation for writing governance services is located in the developer guide:

    - [Open Discovery Services](/guides/developer/open-discovery-services) for metadata discovery.
    - [Governance Action Services](/guides/developer/governance-action-services) for the Governance Action Services: Watchdog Governance Services, Triage Governance Services, Verification Governance Services, Remediation Governance Services and Provisioning Governance Services.


## Integration Groups

An [integration group](/concepts/integration-group) is a collection of [integration connector](/concepts/integration-connector) definitions intended to run in one or more [integration daemons](/concepts/integration-daemon).  The Governance Engine OMAS provides the API to maintain the integration group and integration connector definitions.  The integration daemon then loads the definitions from the integration group and runs the requested integration connectors.  This is an alternative method to configure the integration daemon from adding the integration connectors directly into the integration daemon's configuration document.  The advantage of this approach is that new integration connectors can be added without restarting the integration daemon.

![integration group operation](integration-group-use.svg)

The Governance Engine OMAS supports the creation and maintenance of the metadata that makes up an integration pack.  At the root is the [IntegrationGroup](/types/4/0464-Dynamic-Integration-Group).  Linked to it are the *IntegrationConnector* entities - one for each integration connector that is to run.  Each have a [connection](/concepts/connection) attached that is used to initialize the integration connector.  Optionally, the integration connector can be linked to existing metadata elements via the *CatalogTarget* relationship.  This guides the integration connector on which elements to update - rather than creating new elements.  For example, if the integration connector is cataloguing a specific database and its *Database* entity has already been created, it would be linked to the *IntegrationConnector* entity via the *CatalogTarget* relationship.  The integration connector is able to retrieve the catalog target via its context.

## General metadata governance 

The Governance Engine OMAS supports the standard Open Metadata Store interfaces.
