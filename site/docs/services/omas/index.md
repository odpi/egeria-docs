# Open Metadata Access Services (OMAS)

The Open Metadata Access Services (OMAS) provide domain-specific services for data tools, engines and platforms to integrate with open metadata.  They run in a [Metadata Access Server](/concepts/metadata-access-server).

The access services are as follows:

| [Subject Area](/services/omas/subject-area/overview)                 | The Subject Area OMAS is for tools that support subject matter experts who are defining glossaries, reference data and rules around data for a specific subject area, such as "customer data". It supports the development of a comprehensive definition of the subject area and the standards that support it. These definitions can then be folded into the Governance Program, and used by Asset Owner's to improve the findability and understandability of their assets by linking their asset's structure to relevant parts of the subject area definition. | [Glossary Author OMVS](/services/omvs/glossary-author/overview)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Using the OMAS's


The OMAS's run in a [metadata access server](/concepts/metadata-access-server).  They can be configured and activated individually or as a complete set through the [administration services](/guides/admin/servers/by-section/access-services-section).

Each OMAS typically supports a Java API, an optional topic where it publishes notifications of interest to its callers (called the [OutTopic](/concepts/out-topic)), and an optional topic where new metadata requests can be posted to the OMAS (called the [InTopic](/concepts/in-topic)).

Internally, the Java client calls the REST API of the server module to allow it to reside in remote servers. This java client is embedded in the [integration services](/services/omis), [engine services](/services/omes) and [view services](/services/omvs) to facilitate exchange of metadata between the OMAG servers.

## Inside an OMAS

Although each OMAS provides a unique API, the internal structure of each OMAS is pretty similar.  

Typically, an OMAS supports a Java client interface that runs locally in the metadata tool, service, or application.  These client interfaces support both synchronous and asynchronous calls to the OMAS server-side.

For callers that do not use Java, behind the client there is an OMAS REST API and an event notification interface (typically supported by [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)) that can be called directly.  The event notification interface for each OMAS has a topic to allow an external caller to post metadata updates to the open metadata repositories (OMAS In Topic) and another topic (OMAS Out Topic) to receive relevant updates that have come from other parts of the open metadata and governance ecosystem.

Today, direct calls to the REST APIs and topics are not guaranteed  to be backward compatible.  They are also not documented.  However, we are moving to a position where these interfaces are both documented and supported.  The change in their disposition will occur when the documentation is contributed.

The interfaces are illustrated in Figure 1:

![Figure 1](access-services-overview.svg)
> **Figure 1:** Structure of an Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS)

The OMAS receives metadata from the [Open Metadata Repository Cohort](/concepts/cohort-member)through the [Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS)](/services/omrs).

Figure 2 shows the repository services.

![Figure 2](access-services-repository-services.svg)
> **Figure 2:** Calling the repository services

The OMRS subsystem called the enterprise repository services offers both an Enterprise OMRS Repository Connector and Enterprise OMRS Topic.  The Enterprise OMRS Repository Connector queries all repositories in the cohorts that the local server is connected to.  The Enterprise OMRS Topic aggregates events from all connected cohorts.

The OMAS is passed the enterprise repository service objects at initialization.  It can then register a listener with the Enterprise OMRS Topic to receive the cohort events.

While running, the OMAS can call the Enterprise OMRS Repository Connector directly.  However, there are many common functions that all OMASs need and these are provided by the [common services](/services/#common-services).

Figure 3 shows the common services.

![Figure 3](access-services-common-services.svg)
> Figure 3: Using the common services

The common services provide most of the metadata management implementation logic for the OMASs.  This means that the code in each OMAS's modules is able to
focus on supporting its specific interfaces and mapping them to the common services.

 * The [Repository Handler](/services/repository-handler) provides an object-oriented interface over the Enterprise OMRS Repository Connector.

 * The [Generic Handlers](/services/generic-handlers) provide support for maintaining and accessing specific [Open Metadata Types](/types) (such as Asset, Connection, ...).  They also support calls to metadata security, visibility of metadata based on governance zones and the maintenance of [anchorGUIDs](/concepts/anchor) in dependent instances.

 * [Metadata security](/features/metadata-security/overview) manages calls to the  [OpenMetadataServerSecurityConnector](/concepts/server-metadata-security-connector) if it is installed in the server.
