## Survey action engines

A survey action engine hosts specialized governance services called [survey action services](/concepts/survey-action-service).

The Survey Action OMES is capable of hosting one or more [survey action engines](/concepts/survey-action-engine).

The survey action engine services call the [Asset Owner Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS)](/services/omas/asset-owner/overview) running in a [metadata access server](/concepts/metadata-access-server) to retrieve information about assets and to store the results of the survey action services' work.
