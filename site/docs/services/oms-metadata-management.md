# Open Metadata Store (OMS) Metadata Management

OMS metadata management provides the *Metadata Store Services* that are
consumed by the [Open Connector Framework (OCF)](/frameworks/ocf/overview), [Open Integration Framework (OIF)](/frameworks/oif/overview), [Open Discovery Framework (ODF)](/frameworks/odf/overview), [Governance Action Framework (GAF)](/frameworks/gaf/overview) and are available through all
[Open Metadata Access Services (OMASs)](/services/omas).

OMS metadata management also provides a comprehensive interface for working with all types of metadata, subject to the user's (and the associated OMAS's) security permissions.
the interface supports search, maintenance of metadata elements, classifications and relationships plus the ability to raise incident reports
and todos along with the ability to work with metadata valid values and translations.
