# Data Designer API

The Data Designer API is a REST API that enables the caller to building specifications for data.  This includes common data fields in a data dictionary, data specifications for a project and data classes for data quality validation.

Specifically:

* [Data fields](/concepts/data-field) describe the logical structure of a data item.
* [Data classes](/concepts/data-class) describe the data values that may be stored in the data fields.  Data classes can be used to configure data quality validators running in the [Survey Action Engine](/survey-action-engine).
* [Data structures](/concepts/data-structure) describe the data fields for each required data source in a data specification.
