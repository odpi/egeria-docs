## Inside an OMVS

The OMVS APIs are deployed together in a [View Server](/concepts/view-server). User Interfaces connect to an OMVS through its REST API. The REST API interacts with a remote [Metadata Access Server](/concepts/metadata-access-server) to retrieve and maintain metadata.

## Configuring an OMVS

The [administration services](/services/admin-services/overview) provide the ability to [configure a View Server](/guides/admin/servers/by-server-type/configuring-a-view-server).
