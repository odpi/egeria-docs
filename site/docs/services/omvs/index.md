# Egeria's API

Egeria's APIs provide task oriented, domain-specific REST APIs to open metadata and governance.  They can be consumed directly by application such as a JavaScript web user interface.  The python support in [pyegeria](/guides/developer/python-clients/overview) also uses these APIs.

The APIs are secured with bearer tokens served up by the [OMAG Server Platform](/concepts/omag-server-platform) that is hosting the view services.  The source of the user information used to create and verify the bearer tokens is pluggable through the [metadata security connectors](/features/metadata-security/overview).

## Generic API Services

This first collection of view services provide generic function, using in many situations.

## Inside an API

Egeria's APIs are deployed together in a [View Server](/concepts/view-server). PyEgeria and external services connect to an API through its REST API. The REST API interacts with a remote [Metadata Access Server](/concepts/metadata-access-server) to retrieve and maintain metadata.

Each API is secured with a bearer token.  When a request is received, the view server validates the userId in the bearer token.  The userId is passed in the URL on the calls between the Vire Server and the Metadata Access Store.  These requests are secured with the View Server's bearer token and optional SSL certificates.  Details of the user are included in the repository header of any element that is created, updates or deleted by the user.

## Configuring an API

The View Server included in the standard runtime created by Egeria's build and [Egeria Workspaces](/egeria-workspaces) includes all of the APIs.

If you wish to create your own view server with selected APIs, see [configure a View Server](/guides/admin/servers/by-server-type/configuring-a-view-server) in the [Administration Guide](/guides/admin).
