# Metadata Expert OMVS

The Metadata Expert Open Metadata View Services (OMVS) is a REST API that supports advanced operations for the maintenance of open metadata.  It is an advanced API for users that understand the [Open Metadata Types](/types) because the operations are expressed using these types and the attributes they define, and the results directly reflect the elements and relationships they define.  There are simpler, more specialized maintenance operations in the other view services.
