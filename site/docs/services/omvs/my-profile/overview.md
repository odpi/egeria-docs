# My Profile OMVS

The My Profile Open Metadata View Services (OMVS) is a REST API designed to back user interfaces (UIs) that support personalization.

At the heart of personalization is the personal profile that describes the individual with details such as their name, job role and contact details.  The personal profile then becomes the parent node where the individual can attach and maintain collections of favourite elements such as assets, projects and the profiles of other people in their network.
