# Open Governance Service

The Open Governance Service is defined by the [Governance Action Framework (GAF)](/frameworks/gaf/overview) along with services that support the [Open Metadata Access Services (OMASs)](/services/omas).  It supports the setting up of governance actions such as [governance action processes](/concepts/governance-action-process) and [governance action types](/concepts/governance-action-type), and the initiation of [engine actions](/concepts/engine-action) either directly or via a governance action process or governance action type.
