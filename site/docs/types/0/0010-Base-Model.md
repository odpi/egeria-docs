# 0010 Base model

The base model is the starting point for the open metadata type model.

![UML](0010-Base-Model.svg)

## OpenMetadataRoot entity

*OpenMetadataRoot* is the root entity for all open metadata entity types.

## Referenceable entity

*Referenceable* is the super type for many of the open metadata entity types. A *Referenceable* entity is something that is important enough to be assigned a unique (qualified) name within its type. This unique name is called the *qualifiedName* and may be set to the unique identifier value used outside the open metadata ecosystem. Alternatively, it is often set to a concatenation of an element's type name along with a number of its properties to create a unique string.

Referenceable also has provision for storing additional properties. This is a set of name-value pairs (i.e. a map) where the values are all strings.

## Asset entity

An [Asset](/concepts/asset) is a metadata entity that describes a [resource](/concepts/resource) (either physical or digital) that is of value and so needs to be managed and governed.  [*Infrastructure*](#infrastructure), [*Process*](#process), [*DataStore*](/types/2/0210-Data-Stores), [*DataFeed*](/types/2/0223-Events-and-Logs), [*DeployedAPI*](/types/2/0212-Deployed-APIs), [*DataSet*](#dataset) and [*RunnableSoftwareComponent*](/types/2/0282-Released-Software-Components) are subtypes of *Assets*.

*Asset* is a subtype of [*Referenceable*](#referenceable). It adds three attributes to the *Referenceable* type:

* *name* is the identifier of the asset.  It relates to the name of the [resource](/concepts/resource).
* *versionIdentifier* extends the name with a version identifier.  For example, a process may create a new file every month containing the sales figures for that month.  In this case, the *name* could be `"MonthlySalesFigures.csv"` and the *versionIdentifier* could be `"july2022"`.  The *name* and *versionIdentifier* are useful values for constructing the [*qualifiedName*](#referenceable).
* *description* provides a description of the resource.

??? deprecated "Deprecated attributes"
    The *Asset* entity has the following deprecated attributes. Their values have been moved to classifications as shown in the table below. Many Assets are created by their hosting technology and locked read-only to the broader metadata ecosystem (see [external metadata provenance](/features/metadata-provenance/overview) for more detail). By moving the governance related information to a classification, it can be maintained by a different service to the Asset's creator.

    | Deprecated attribute | Moved to classification |
    |---|---|
    | `owner` (type `string`) | [Ownership](/types/4/0445-Governance-Roles/#ownership) |
    | `ownerType` (type `AssetOwnerType` enum) | [Ownership](/types/4/0445-Governance-roles/#ownership) |
    | `zoneMembership` (type `array<string>`) | [AssetZoneMembership](/types/4/0424-Governance-Zones/#assetzonemembership) |
    | `latestChange` (type `string`) | [LatestChange](/types/0/0011-Managing-Referenceables/#latestchange) |

The values set in an *Asset* entity tend to be focused around the implementation of the resource.  The [*SupplementaryProperties*](/types/3/0395-Supplementary-Properties) relationship allows a more business-oriented description to be attached.

More information on assets can be found in the [Metadata Manager](/patterns/metadata-manager/overview) overview.

### Infrastructure entity

*Infrastructure* represents both the physical and digital assets that the organization runs its business on. [*ITInfrastructure*](/types/0/0030-Hosts-and-Platforms) is a subtype of *Infrastructure* describing Information Technology (IT) infrastructure that runs IT services.  There is more information on the different types of *ITInfrastructure* in:

- [0030 Hosts and platforms](/types/0/0030-Hosts-and-Platforms)
- [0035 Complex hosts](/types/0/0035-Complex-Hosts)
- [0037 Software server platforms](/types/0/0037-Software-Server-Platforms)
- [0040 Software servers](/types/0/0040-Software-Servers)
- [0042 Software capabilities](/types/0/0042-Software-Capabilities)

### Process entity

*Process* describes a well-defined set of processing steps and decisions that drive a particular aspect of the organization's business. Most processes are automated with software (see [*DeployedSoftwareComponent*](/types/2/0215-Software-Components/#deployedsoftwarecomponent)) but they may also be a manual procedure. An automated process can be invoked from a remote server through a [*DeployedAPI*](/types/2/0212-deployed-apis/#deployedapi).

Processes have an advanced lifecycle.  They can have the following [instance statuses](/concepts/instance-status).

* Draft
* Proposed
* Approved
* Active
* Deleted

The *formula* attribute can describe its behaviour, *formulaType* describes the notation language used to describe the formula.

### DataSet entity

*DataSet* represents a collection of related data. This data does not need to be stored together. The *formula* property describes the logic used to populate the DataSet, *formulaType* describes the notation language used to describe the formula, and *deployedImplementationType* describes the technology supporting the implementation of the technology. 

See [*DataStore*](/types/2/0210-Data-Stores) for the `Asset` that represents a physical store and the [*DataContentForDataSet*](/types/2/0210-Data-Stores/#datacontentfordataset) relationship links the DataSet to the asset(s) that describe the data sources.

## SampleData relationship

The *SampleData* relationship links an *Asset* entity describing a collection of sample data that originates from the resource represented by the *Referenceable* entity.

## Anchors classification

The *Anchors* classification is used internally by the open metadata ecosystem to optimize the lookup of the entity at the root of a cluster of elements that represents a larger object. Currently, there is support for objects uniquely "owned" by an entity to store the GUID of that entity.

!!! info "Further information on the use of Anchors"
    * [Anchor Management](/concepts/anchor).

## Memento classification

Finally, the *Memento* classification identifies that the Referenceable entity it is attached to, refers to a real-world asset/artifact that has either been deleted or archived offline. The entity has been retained to show its role in the [lineage of other assets/artifacts](/features/lineage-management/overview). The properties in this classification identifies the archive processing and any information that helps to locate the asset/artifact in the archive (if applicable).
