## RelatedMedia

*`RelatedMedia`* such as images allow an icon, thumbnail and larger images to be associated with a metadata element. They are intended to be displayed with the metadata content. These images enrich the description of the object and may include, for example, design drawings, photographs or illustrations of the component in action.
