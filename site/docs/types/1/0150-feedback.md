# 0150 Feedback

An important principle of good metadata it to be continually capturing the experience of subject matter experts. The feedback model captures comments and ratings from subject matter experts.

![UML](0150-feedback.svg)

Comments and ratings are a key mechanism for providing feedback on the metadata definitions by any user.  

*Note:* that because comments inherit from [Referenceable](0010-base-model.md) they can be tagged, rated and commented on.
