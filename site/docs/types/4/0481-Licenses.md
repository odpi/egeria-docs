# 0481 Licenses

The data economy brings licensing to data and metadata.  Even open data typically has a license.

The license will define the permitted uses and other requirements for using the asset.

Details of a type of license are described in a [*LicenseType*](0440-Organizational-Controls). 

The element that is licensed is identified with the *License* relationship. This relationship is a *multi-link* relationship so the same license type, with different dates, can be linked to the same element.
