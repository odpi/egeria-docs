# 0615 Schema Extraction

Schema extraction creates a set of metadata entities that represent how the data is structured in the digital resource. 

This is then either matched with an existing schema or
a new schema is created (see [Area 5](/types/5)).
This may be completely automated, or with stewards assistance.
