Key digital services, such as digital products and systems often provide the focus for governance activity such as data privacy, data quality or cyber-security.  They typically have executive ownership and provide a key digital capability that enables the organization to function properly.

The digital product manager provides the human link from these digital products to the organization.  Also see [Model 0440 Organizational Controls](/types/4/0440-Organizational-Controls/) for links to the organizations that rely on the digital products.
