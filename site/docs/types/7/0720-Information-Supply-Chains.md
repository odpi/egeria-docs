# 0720 Information Supply Chains

Lineage is typically captured from the running technology at a very fine-level of detail.  This detail enables automated governance processes to validate that the data pipelines are running as they should be.  However, this level of detail is too much for most business users and regulators to comprehend.  Therefore, it is necessary to model the flow of data at a level of detail that is meaningful to these users and correlate the fine-grained detail to this business view.

An *InformationSupplyChain* is the highest level of abstraction for lineage.  It typically identifies the flow of a particular type of data across a digital landscape.  For example, there may be an information supply chain capturing risk data for a regulatory compliance report, and another one showing how the data necessary for carbon accounting is assembled.

It is an architectural construct that can provide the focus for data governance activities that ensure data is delivered where it is needed in a timely and efficient manner.

The information supply chain is typically broken down into segments also represented by *InformationSupplyChain* entities that each define a particular exchange of data.  For example, it may be the flow of data through a specific business unit or country.  The segments are linked to their parent information supply chain via the *InformationSupplyChainComposition* relationship.  Their relationship to one another, and its logical sources and destinations are captured using *InformationSupplyChainLink* relationships.

The unique names of the information supply chains, are encoded in the lineage relationships captured in the lower levels of lineage detail:

* The architectural view of the flow of data that the information supply chain represents is described using [solution components](/types/7/0730-Solution-Components) that are linked via [ports and wires](/types/7/0735-Solution-Ports-and-Wires).  The [*SolutionLinkingWire*](/types/7/0735-Solution-Ports-and-Wires) contains the unique names (qualifiedName) of the information supply chains that it implements.  The is is required because multiple information supply chains may share a part of the data flow.

* The fine-grained view captured from the implementation and operation of the deployed technology is described using the [data passing](/types/7/0750-Data-Passing) and [lineage mapping](/types/7/0770-Lineage-Mapping)  relationships.

If additional processing is required to move the data between solution components *along the wire*, for example via an ETL process, this is shown by an *ImplementedBy* relationship between the information supply chain and the [Process](/types/0/0010-Base-Model) that represents the implementation.  Alternatively, the component that provides the data movement can be show explicitly as a solution component in the [solution blueprint](/types/7/0740-Solution-Blueprints).

## InformationSupplyChain entity

An *InformationSupplyChain* entity is a [Referenceables](/types/0/0010-Base-Model) that identifies an information supply chain.  It contains the description of the purposes and scope of the information supply chain and the description of its importance to the business.

## InformationSupplyChainComposition relationship

The *InformationSupplyChainComposition* relationship links an *InformationSupplyChain* entity to its segments.

## InformationSupplyChainLink

The *InformationSupplyChainLink* relationship links an information supply chain's components, and descriptions of the data sources and destinations together into a graph.  This graph represents the highest level abstraction of the operation of the information supply chain. The *label* and *description* attributes help to explain how/why the information supply chain progresses.

## Example

The diagram below shows a simple example of an information supply chain that shows how weekly measurements from the Drop Foot clinical trial are brought into the data lake for processing.

At the top is the *InformationSupplyChain* entity.  It has two segments:

* From hospital to landing area
* From landing area to data lake

These segments represent the different parts of the flow.  The first segment, from the hospital to the landing area is not modelled in detail since it is out of the control of Coco Pharmaceuticals.  It is the responsibility of the hospital to get the files to their respective landing areas.

The second segment from the landing area to the data lake is the responsibility of Coco Pharmaceuticals.  They are required to process the incoming files immediately, so they have a continuous monitoring process to kick off the onboarding process.  The onboarding process moves the files to the correct location in the data lake and catalogs them appropriately in the open metadata ecosystem via calls to the cocoMDS1 metadata access server.
