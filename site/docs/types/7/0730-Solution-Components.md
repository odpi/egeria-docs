## SolutionComponent

A *SolutionComponent* is an architecture description of a digital implementation that provides a well-defined function.  They can be modelled as *UML components* and provide a way to organize the digital landscape into course-grained functional components. Solution components communicate via [ports and wires](/types/7/0735-Solution-Ports-and-Wires).

## SolutionComposition

The *SolutionComposition* relationship allows solution components to be decomposed into smaller solution components.
