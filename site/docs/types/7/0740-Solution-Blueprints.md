# 0740 Solution Blueprints

A [solution blueprint](/concepts/solution-blueprint) describes the architecture of a digital service, or a new capability, in terms of [solution components](/types/7/0730-Solution-Components).

![UML](0740-Solution-Blueprints.svg)

## SolutionBlueprint

The *SolutionBlueprint* entity describes a single version of the digital service's design.  It inherits from [DesignModel]()

## DigitalServiceDesign

There can be multiple solution blueprints for a digital service that each describe a version of its implementation.  The *DigitalServiceDesign* relationship identifies which [digital service](/types/7/0710-Digital-Service) the blueprint describes.

## SolutionBlueprintComposition

The *SolutionBlueprintComposition* relationship identifies the list of solution components that implement the digital service.  The definition of the solution components shows [how they are linked together](/types/7/0735-Solution-Ports-and-Wires) and so SolutionBlueprintComposition simply documents the role each solution component plays in supporting the digital service.
