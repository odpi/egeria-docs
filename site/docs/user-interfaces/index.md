# The Egeria User Interfaces

Most metadata is created and used through the tools and platforms (third party technologies) that are integrated into the open metadata ecosystem.  These third party technologies show the metadata that is stored in their own repositories.  This could be metadata that has been created within the third party technology or metadata that has been added by the open metadata ecosystem. 

Egeria adds two specialized user interfaces that view metadata across the open metadata ecosystem, irrespective of which technology originated it, or where it is stored.  

| User Interface Name                                    | Description                                                                     |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Egeria General UI](/user-interfaces/general/overview) | A user interface for searching and viewing metadata, including lineage.         | 
| [Egeria Ecosystem UI](/user-interfaces/ecosystem)      | A user interface for editing metadata and managing the open metadata ecosystem. |  

These user interfaces are experimental and under constant development, and it is worthwhile to keep engaged with the community members that are developing them.
