There is a lot of common functions that are used repeatedly during the surveying process.

A *survey action pipeline* is a specialized implementation of a [survey action service](/concepts/survey-action-service) that runs a set of survey action services against a single [digital resource](/concepts/digital-resource).  The implementation of the pipeline determines the order that these services are run.

Each service in the pipeline is able to access the results of the services that have run before it through the [survey context](/frameworks/osf/overview/#survey-context).  The combined results of the pipeline are grouped into a single [survey report](/concepts/survey-report) linked off of the asset.

The aim of the survey action pipeline is to enable reusable survey action service implementations to be choreographed together for different types of digital resource.
