An *survey action service* is a component that performs analysis of the contents of a [digital resource](/concepts/digital-resource) on request.  The aim of the survey action service is to enable a detailed picture of the properties of a resource to be built up.

Each time a survey action service runs, it creates a new [survey report](/concepts/survey-report) linked off of the digital resource's [Asset](/concepts/asset) metadata element that records the results of the analysis.

> Each time an survey action service runs to analyse a digital resource, a new survey report is created and attached to the resource's asset.  If the survey action service is run regularly, it is possible to track how the contents are changing over time.

The *survey report* contains one or more sets of related properties that the survey action service has discovered about the resource, its metadata, structure and/or content.  These are stored in a set of [*annotations*](/concepts/survey-report/#annotations) linked off of the survey report.

An survey action service is designed to run at regular intervals to gather a detailed perspective on the contents of the digital resource and how they are changing over time.  Each time it runs, it is given access to the results of previously run survey-action services, along with a review of these findings made by individuals responsible for the digital resource (such as stewards, owners, custodians).

??? info "Runtime for an survey action service"
    Survey action services are packaged into [Survey Action Engines](/concepts/survey-action-engine) that run in the [Survey Action OMES](/services/omes/survey-action/overview) hosted in an [Engine Host](/concepts/engine-host).  

    The metadata repository interface for metadata discovery tools is implemented by the [Asset Owner OMAS](/services/omas/asset-owner/overview) that runs in a [Metadata Access Server](/concepts/metadata-access-server).

    A survey action service may be triggered via an [Engine Action](/concepts/engine-action), a [governance action type](/concepts/overnance-action-type) or as part of a [governance action process](/concepts/governance-action-process).
