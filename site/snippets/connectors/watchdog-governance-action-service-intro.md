The *watchdog governance action service* monitors changes in the metadata and initiates one of the following as a result:

- [engine action](/concepts/engine-action
- [governance action process](/concepts/governance-action-process)
- [incident report](/concepts/incident-report)

One example of a watchdog governance action service is to monitor for new [assets](/concepts/asset). Another example is to monitor the addition of open discovery reports and take action on their content.
