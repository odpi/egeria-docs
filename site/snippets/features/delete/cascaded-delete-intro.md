A number of delete API operations support a boolean *cascadedDelete* option.  This adds extra checks and functionality to delete requests.  

The default value is `false` which means that the element can not be deleted if certain dependent elements are still attached.  These elements are not typically anchored to this element but have an important relationship.  

If cascadedDelete is `true`, the element can be deleted irrespective of its related elements.  It may also delete some of these related elements along with its [anchored elements](/features/anchor-management/overview).

The table below shows the specific behaviour for each affected open metadata type.  Notice that setting `cascadeDelete=true` is a powerful option that can delete a lot of metadata - so use with care ...

??? expert "Implementation details"
    The rules for cascaded deletes are coded in the [generic handlers](/services/generic-handlers).  Specifically in method `validateCascadedDelete` in class `OpenMetadataAPIGenericHandler`.  This means that the same delete logic runs regardless of the API call used to request the delete operation.
