[**Egeria Workspaces**](/egeria-workspaces) is the best way to run Egeria if you are new to this technology.  It offers a preconfigured, containerized environment that you can quickly download and run.  Once running, Egeria workspaces has a Jupyter notebook, command line and a Markdown environment for activating [Egeria's solutions](/egeria-solutions) and configuring them to work with your organization's digital resources.  There is also a web server, Apache Kafka Event Bus, an Open Lineage Proxy and a PostgreSQL server to play with.  

Each major capability of Egeria is demonstrated through Jupyter Notebooks, helping you to understand and apply Egeria to your organization's needs as quickly as possible. As you become familiar with Egeria, you can activate additional runtimes such as Unity Catalog, Apache Atlas, Apache Airflow and Apache Superset to make use of the integration between Egeria and these runtimes.  Egeria workspaces are set up to run Egeria's [solutions](/egeria-solutions).  If you are looking for something different, [Egeria's patterns](/patterns) describe how the commonly useful capabilities of Egeria can be consumed.

In addition to Egeria Workspaces, deployment options include:

* Using the command line: The [Getting Started with Egeria](https://getting-started-with-egeria.pdr-associates.com/introduction.html) blog provides a step-by-step guide to building, installing, configuring and running Egeria on your machine using the command line.

* Running Egeria in IntelliJ: see [Setting up IntelliJ to develop components for Egeria](https://egeria-project.org/education/tutorials/developer-intellij-tutorial/overview/).

* Running Egeria in Kubernetes: see sample helm charts in [https://github.com/odpi/egeria-charts](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-charts).
