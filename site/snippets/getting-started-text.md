[**Egeria Workspaces**](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-workspaces) is the best way to run Egeria if you are new to this technology.  It offers a preconfigured, containerized environment that you can quickly download and run.  Once running, Egeria workspaces offers a Jupyter, command line and a Markdown environment for activating Egeria's governance solutions and configuring them to work with your organization's digital resources.  There is also a web server, Apache Kafka Event Bus, an Open Lineage Proxy and a PostgreSQL server to play with.  

Each major capability of Egeria is demonstrated through Jupyter Notebooks, helping you to understand and apply Egeria to your organization's needs as quickly as possible. As you become familiar with Egeria, you can activate additional runtimes such as Unity Catalog, Apache Atlas, Apache Airflow and Apache Superset to make use of the integration between Egeria and these runtimes.

In addition to Egeria Workspaces:

* The [Getting Started with Egeria](https://getting-started-with-egeria.pdr-associates.com/introduction.html) blog provides a step-by-step guide to building, installing, configuring and running Egeria on your machine using the command line.
