## Release 6.0 (January 2026)

_**These are DRAFT release notes.  The notes will be updated until & when 6.0 is released**_

??? functional "Open Metadata Types"
    The [open metadata types](/types) have had a major overhaul.  

    * Many common attributes have bubbled up to *Referenceable* and *Asset* - see [Model 0010 - Base Model](/types/0/0010-Base-Model).
    * Human and automated actions such as [to dos](/concepts/to-do) and [engine actions](/concepts/governance-action) have a common super-type of [Action].  This is in recognition that many governance tasks are shifting between human and automated implementation with AI.
    * Entity types such as *Glossary*, *SolutionBlueprint*, *DigitalProduct* and *DesignModel* are now types of *Collections*.  This has meant that the relationships that were used to show membership/composition for these types are no longer needed.
    * Many of the governance implementation entity types now inherit from *GovernanceDefinition*, reducing the effort to set up a governance program.  This includes the [governance actions](/concepts/governance-action).
    * The workflow engine that runs governance action processes now uses the standard lineage [ControlFlow](/types/7/0750-Data-Passing) to link engine actions together.  This makes it easier to show the lineage from Egeria's processes in conjunction with other processing engines.

??? functional "Classification History and LatestChange classification"
    The open metadata repositories have a new operation to return the history (versions) for an entity's classification.  The operation takes the entity's GUID and the name of the classification of interest.

    In recognition of this new capability, *LatestChange* classifications are now added to the following types of elements: [Actor](/types/1/0110-Actors), [Asset](/types/0/0010-Base-Model), [Collection](/types/0/0021-Collections), [Community](/types/1/0140-Communities), [DesignModelElement](/types/5/0565-Design-Models), [GlossaryTerm](/types/3/0330-Terms), [GovernanceDefinition](/types/4/0401-Governance-Definitions), and [Project](/types/1/0130-Projects), each time an anchored element is changed.

??? functional "New View Service: Notification Manager OMVS"
    [Notification Manager OMVS](/services/omvs/notification-manager/overview) supports the management and querying of [ToDos](/concepts/to-do) and [IncidentReports](/concepts/incident-report).

??? functional "New View Service: Data Discovery OMVS"
    [Data Discovery OMVS](/services/omvs/data-discovery/overview) supports the creation of survey reports and annotations for survey engines running outside of Egeria.

??? functional "New View Service: Reference Data OMVS"
    [Reference Data OMVS](/services/omvs/reference-data/overview) supports the query and maintenance of code values and reference data.
