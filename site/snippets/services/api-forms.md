??? education "API forms"
    The API has three forms:

    * An Open Metadata View Service (OMVS) REST API designed to support user interfaces (UIs) and integration logic.
    * A python client library for use in tools, such as Jupyter Notebooks and Apache Airflow, or command line scripts, or Egeria's very own Dr.Egeria, hey_egeria and my_egeria.
    * Java context clients for use by [connector developers](/guides/developer/#extending-egeria-using-connectors).
