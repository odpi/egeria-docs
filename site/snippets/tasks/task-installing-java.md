### Installing Java

[Java](https://www.java.com) is a relatively mature object-oriented programming language that was originally designed to be able to easily run programs across a number of different computer systems.

The Egeria project itself is primarily written in Java, and therefore a *Java Runtime Environment (JRE)* is the most basic component needed in order to run Egeria.

You will need a **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed on your machine in order to build Egeria.  (A JDK will include a JRE.)

There are various JREs/JDKs available, and you may even have one pre-installed on your system. You can check
if java is already installed by running the command `java -version` from the command-line.

Java can be installed by:

1. Downloading the *OpenJDK 17 (LTS) HotSpot* JVM from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/).
2. Running the installer that is downloaded.

Alternatively you may wish to install from your package manager such as `homebrew` on macOS.
