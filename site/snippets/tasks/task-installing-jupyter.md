### Installing runtime for Jupyter Notebooks

The Jupyter project provides two runtime options for Jupyter Notebooks

- *JupyterLab* for a single user environment
- *JupyterHub* for a multi-user environment

Full instructions for downloading and installing either of these options can be found at:

`https://jupyter.org/`

Alternatively, if you are running macOS you can use HomeBrew.

???+ cli "Installing JupyterLab on macOS using HomeBrew"
    Using [HomeBrew :material-dock-window:](https://brew.sh){ target=homebrew } you can simply run:

    ```shell
    brew install jupyterlab
    ```
