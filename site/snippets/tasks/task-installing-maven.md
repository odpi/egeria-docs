### Installing Maven

[Apache Maven :material-dock-window:](https://maven.apache.org/){ target=maven } is a build tool at is being phased out in the Egeria project, but is still required by some repositories and the Egeria developer dojo. It is capable of code compilation, running unit tests, validating dependencies and Javadoc as well as build our distribution archive.

Where it is used, Egeria requires Maven 3.5 or higher. 3.6.x or above is recommended.

!!! cli "Check if Maven is installed"
    ```shell
    mvn --version
    ```

Maven can be installed by downloading the software from the Apache maven website and unpacking it into a directory that is included in your `PATH`. Alternatively these methods are available:
