The [egeria build process](/education/tutorials/building-egeria-tutorial/overview) creates the distribution files for Egeria in the `open-metadata-distribution/open-metadata-assemblies` module.   To see its contents, after a full gradle build completes, use the following `cd` command to change to its `build/distributions` directory:

```bash
cd open-metadata-distribution/omag-server-platform/build/distributions
```
List the files:
```bash
ls
```
The distribution tar file is `{release}-distribution.tar.gz` or `egeria-platform-4.3-distribution.tar.gz` in this example.

```bash
egeria-platform-4.3-distribution.tar.gz
```

Create a directory for Egeria and copy the tar file into it. The two commands shown below creates a directory in your home directory and then copies the egeria distribution file into it.

```bash
mkdir ~/egeria-install
```
```bash
cp egeria*-distribution.tar.gz ~/egeria-install
```

These next commands change to the new directory and lists its contents.

```bash
cd ~/egeria-install
```

It is now possible to unpack the tar file with the following steps.

```bash
gunzip egeria*-distribution.tar.gz
```
```bash
tar -xf egeria*-distribution.tar
```
A new directory is created called `{release}-distribution.tar.gz` or `egeria-4.2-distribution.tar.gz` in this example.  Change to this new directory and list its contents as shown below.

```bash
cd egeria*gz
```
```bash
ls
```
```bash
Dockerfile      LICENSE         NOTICE          README.md       assembly        dist
```
As before, you may notice different files as Egeria evolves.

The `Dockerfile` contains the directives to build a docker image.  Instructions for doing this are in the `README.md` file.  Change to the `assembly` directory.

```bash
cd assembly
```
```bash
ls
```
```bash
README.md       etc             opt             platform
```
Under `platform` is a directory for the [OMAG Server Platform](/concepts/omag-server-platform) that is used to run open metadata and governance services.  This is the `omag-server-platform-{{release}}.jar`.  

```bash
ls platform
```
```bash
README.md                       data                            keystore.p12                    logs                            truststore.p12

```
The `platform/lib` directory is where the jar files for connectors, samples and new registered services are installed.  It includes the connectors that are located in the `egeria.git` repository.
```bash
ls platform/lib
```
```bash

The `platform/extra` directory is where connectors from other repositories are added (including those that you write yourself).  Copy the jar files for any additional connectors you want to use into the `extra` directory.  The connectors available for Egeria are listed in the [Connector Catalog](/connectors).

The `opt` and `etc` directories contain additional content that can used with the platform.  For example, the `etc/reports` directory contains java programs that describe different aspects of the platform.
```bash
ls etc/reports
```
```bash
README.md                       component-id-report.jar         database-report.jar             egeria-platform-report.jar
```
The `opt/content-packs` directory contains [Open Metadata Archives](/concepts/open-metadata-archive) that provide sample open metadata content.  The `README.md` describes their content.
```bash
ls content-packs
```
```bash

The `/opt/sample-data` directory contains sample data that is used in various labs and samples.
```bash
ls /opt/sample-data/*
```
```bash
